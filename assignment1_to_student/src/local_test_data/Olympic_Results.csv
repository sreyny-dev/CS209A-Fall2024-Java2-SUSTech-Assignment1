It was expected that they would contest the gold medal with the United States. Australia was led off by Dawn Fraser, the greatest women’s sprinter ever, and she put them into the lead. The third leg came down to Lorraine Crapp for Australia against 14-year-old Carolyn Wood of the USA, who had failed to finish the 100 butterfly final when she gulped too much water on the final lap. Crapp had her own problems in Rome, as she had secretly married Bill Thurlow, an Australian team doctor, the night before the team left for Rome. This was not allowed and when it was discovered it was scandalous to the Australians, and Crapp was closely watched during the Rome Games. For whatever reason, Crapp swam poorly in the relay, Wood outdistancing her by 2.7 seconds and handing the lead to American anchor Chris von Saltza, who had no difficulty maintaining it to win in world record time of 4:08.9, almost seven seconds better than the previous mark.

Pursuit-style cross-country race, with skiers leaving in order of their finish in the ski jumping, so that final placement determined by final placement in cross-country ski race.",na,"A sprint event had been contested at the World Championships in 1999 and 2001, won by Bjarte Engen Vik in 1999 and Germany’s Marco Baacke in 2001, who was not in Salt Lake City. In 2001 the silver medalist had been Finnish athlete Samppa Lajunen, followed by German Ronny Ackermann. The event consisted of a single jump on the large hill followed by a 7½ km cross-country race, started by the Gundersen Method with the jumping leaders going off first, in the order of their finish. On the large hill, Lajunen took the lead with a jump of 126.5 metres, to take a 3.9 point margin over Ackermann, which gave the Finn a 15 second start lead in the cross-country. In third place after the jumping was Lajunen’s teammate, Jaakko Tallus, who had already won a silver medal in the individual event in Salt Lake City. Lajunen and Ackermann were never challenged in the ski race, with Ackermann closing slightly but unable to catch Lajunen, who won by 9 seconds. Tallus could not hold onto the bronze, being passed by Austrian Felix Gottwald in the last kilometer of the ski race.
For Lajunen it was his third gold medal in Nordic combined at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Prior to his feats at Salt Lake City he was better known in Finland as a rock star, as he was the songwriter and guitarist of the group Vieraileva Tahti, or Guest Star, which also contained several other Nordic skiers.

But he had big challengers in East Germany’s Ulf Timmermann and Udo Beyer and America’s Randy Barnes. Timmermann was the world record holder with 23.06 (75-8) set in May 1988. Günthör opened in round one with 21.45 (70-4½) but Timmermann took the lead at the end of the round with 22.02 (72-3). That led thru round two, although Günthör improved to 21.59 (70-10). He improved again in the next round with 21.70 (71-2½) but Timmermann opened up a bit with 22.16 (72-8½). Beyer moved into third in round two with 21.40 (70-2½) while Barnes languished in fourth after three rounds, throwing only 20.72 (67-11¾) in the second. But he improved to 21.31 (69-11), but it did not improve his position. Round five saw Günthör improve to 21.99 (72-1¾), still in second, and Timmermann again improved his mark with 22.29 (73-1¾). Beyer and Günthör were done, having recorded their best marks, and seemingly securing medals. Then Barnes unleased an Olympic record 22.39 (73-5½) in the final round to move into the lead ahead of Timmermann, pushing Beyer to fourth. Timmermann was the last thrower of the competition, and responded with an Olympic record of 22.47 (73-8¾) to win the gold medal. The top three marks have still never been surpassed at the Olympics, possibly the victim of more stringent drug testing. Athletics historian Richard Hymans has called this )the greatest shot competition ever).

The Netherlands also had the best second round, tying the United States with only 8.00 faults, and their total of 12.00 faults brought them the gold medal comfortably over Austria, which had 12 faults in the second round. France held on for the bronze medal, despite placing only =6th in the second round. The US had been only eighth in round one, so their solid second round could only move them up to fifth.

In round two Crouser threw a PR 22.22, which was the world leading mark for the year, and that would win the gold medal for him. Kovacs and Elemba never improved on their opening marks. New Zealander Tom Walsh threw 21.36 in round five to win bronze, pushing Elemba off the podium. Crouser improved in round three with another PR of 22.26, and then in round five bettered that with an Olympic record 22.52, as he dominated the competition. Storl was never a factor, barely making the final round, and placing seventh.

The only American who competed at Stockholm, Roosevelt Pell, was not of the top rank, his best finish ever at the United States’ championships coming in 1915, when he lost in the semi-finals.
In Wildings absence, the Olympic men’s singles final came down to two South Africans, Charles Winslow and Harry Kitson.  Kitson had the better career record, winning the South African championship in 1905, 1908, 1911, and 1913, while Winslow would win that title only once, in 1914.  But at Stockholm, Winslow held on to defeat Kitson and win the Olympic gold medal in four sets.

The United States, meanwhile, was the reigning Pan American champion, but in the opening heats it was Canada, who had taken bronze at the most edition, who won their heat, while the Americans trailed behind the Romanian and Dutch squads. In the final, Romania and Canada finished first and second by a comfortable margin, leaving the United States to battle with Australia for the final podium spot.

(121.9 miles) mass start race.,na,"The road race course consisted of eight laps of a 24.525 km. course, which was quite hilly.  The course allowed the field to break apart more so than in any Olympic road race since the mass start format had begun in 1936. There was no heavy favorite as the last three World Championships had seen nine different riders on the podium. Pierfranco Vianelli broke away from the leading group on the last lap and won with almost a minute and a half to spare. Runner-up Leif Mortensen won the 1969 World Championship. Vianelli had a great professional début the following year, placing seventh in the Tour de France. After that little was heard of him until he concluded an impressive solo win at the Giro d’Italia stage on top of the Großglockner – his last major win.
The Mexico race featured several future cycling greats. “Jempi” Monseré finished in fifth place, but won the professional world title in 1970. Six months later, the Belgian was killed in a collision with a car during a race. Compatriot Roger De Vlaeminck (18th) was the best classics cyclist during the 1970s, excelling in the grueling Paris-Roubaix race, which he won four times. In 2005, De Vlaeminck presented a Belgian television show in which he coached several cyclists from Zimbabwe to appear in the World Cyclo-Cross Championships. Finally, non-finisher Joop Zoetemelk would become a Tour de France winner in 1980, and was second in “La Grand Boucle” no less than six times.

Each nation was allowed a maximum of four competitors.  Not strictly a true “3-Day Event” as we now know it, the event was termed the “Military Riding Competition” in 1912.  In addition, it took place over four days, not three.  Section scores were calculated by using the percentage of possible scores in each section multipled by 10.  The maximum by sections were the following:  Section 1 - long-distance ride of 55 km., maximum 10 points; Section 2 - 5 km. cross-country ride with natural obstacles of fences, ditches, and streams, held as a portion of the long-distance ride, maximum 130 points, scaled down to 10 points; Section 3 - 3,500 metre steeplechase, maximum 100 points, scaled down to 10 points; Section 4 - Jumping competition, maximum 150 points, scaled down to 10 points; and Section 5 - Dressage, maximum 770 points, scaled down to 10 points.  As an example, in dressage (section 5), Nordlander scored 590 in the dressage or .766 of maximum, which gave him a score of 7.66 for the dressage.
The event opened with the 55 km. ride on a day that was described as oppressively hot.  Still, 26 of the 27 riders finished the course, with only one (Albert Seigner [FRA]) outside the time limit of four hours.  In the cross-country portion of the ride, held concurrently, three riders rode the wrong way and were disqualified, but 13 posted perfect scores of 130.  Thus after two sections, 13 riders were tied for first place.  Two days later, 22 riders started the steeplechase section, but it did little to separate the logjam at the top.  Seventeen of the 22 posted perfect scores of 100 in this section, and 9 riders remained tied for first with total scores of 30 after this section.
The jumping (section four) was won by Ernst Casparsson (SWE) who scored 145 of 150 points.  Bernard Meyer (FRA) and Friedrich von Rochow (GER) each scored 143 to move into a tie for first place with totals of 39.53, with only the dressage remaining.  Only 15 riders started the dressage, which was won by Jean Cariou (FRA), who scored 594.2 points (of 770 possible) to move into 3rd place overall.  The second best dressage score was posted by Axel Nordlander of Sweden, who had been in 7th place going into the last section.  Nordlander scored 590 points in the dressage, and his adjusted score of 7.66 enabled him to move into first place overall.  Nordlander won, in addition to his gold medal, the German Emperor’s Challenge Prize.

Wilhelm was a cross-country skier at the 1998 Winter Olympics, but her best finish of 16th in the 30 km led her to switch to biathlon. She was the 18th starter, the first of the favorites to go off, and shot cleanly throughout to finish in 20:41.4. In the 37th start spot, the 1998 silver medalist, Uschi Disl, finished in 20:57.0, missing one target, which cost her the gold medal that would go to Wilhelm.

Lenina, Moskva",23 from 19 countries,na,na,"Viktor Saneyev was trying to match Al Oerter’s feat of winning four consecutive gold medals in the same individual event. But the favorite in 1980 was Brazil’s João Carlos de Oliveira, world record holder and twice Pan American champion. Two other contenders were Keith Connor (GBR) and Ian Campbell (AUS) – who had been 1-2 at the 1978 Commonwealth Games. The 1980 Olympics were held in Moskva, and unfortunately, the officiating was not what it should have been. Round three produced much of the drama. Jaak Uudmäe (URS/EST) jumped 17.35 (56-11¼), with de Oliveira getting 17.22 (56-6) and Saneyev at 17.04 (55-11) – all three producing their leading marks to that point. But just before Uudmäe’s jump, Campbell had landed in the sand beyong the Olympic record marker (17.39 (57-0¾)), but the jump was ruled a foul that had not broken the plasticine. Pleading his case, the official told him he had dragged his foot on the step phase, which is almost impossible at that speed, and which nobody had seen. The sand was raked and the mark did not count, though observers thought it was around 17.50 (57-7). In fact, all of Campbell’s remaining marks were ruled fouls.
João de Oliveira also would not produce another fair jump, though observers also could not see anything wrong with his efforts, and two of his “fouls” were on very long jumps. Both times he walked away from the board, after examining it, shaking his head in frustration. The spurious officiating brought Saneyev a chance in the last round to win his fourth gold medal. He improved to 17.24 (56-6¾) to surpass de Oliveira but had to settle for silver. It was difficult for de Oliveira. But in December 1991 he was struck head-on by a drunken driver and after a nine-month battle, would lose his right leg, having it amputated below the knee. He died quite early from liver and lung disease, complications of the alcoholism which had consumed him.

After a fall from the pommel horse that nearly cost Japan a medal in the team competition and a disappointing ninth-place finish in the qualification round, however, some of his challengers were holding out hope that they could steal the crown away from the sport’s most recent star. Not a single medalist from the last three World Championships made it to the final (aside from Uchimura), which placed Danell Leyva of the United States, the reigning parallel bars World Champion, in the best position to dethrone Uchimura, having finished first in the qualifiers. With compatriot John Orozco finishing fourth, the Americans had a strong shot at a medal, if they could get past David Belyavsky of Russia and Fabian Hambüchen of Germany, 2008 Olympic bronze medalist and 2007 World Champion on the horizontal bar, who had qualified second and third respectively.
By about the halfway point of the event, it was clear that Uchimura was inching his way towards the gold medal and creating an ever-widening gap between himself and the rest of the field. By the end of the competition he had finished in first or second on four of the six apparatuses with a string of consistently strong performances that reminded the audience why he was three-time World, and now Olympic, Champion. Marcel Nguyen of Germany, who scored highest in both rings and parallel bars, came in second and won his nation’s first medal in the individual all-around since Alfred Schwarzmann and Konrad Frey won gold and bronze respectively in 1936. Leyva came up from behind, meanwhile, and scored top marks in the final two events, the parallel bars and the horizontal bars, to jump ahead and onto the podium, claiming the bronze medal for the United States.

After all, she had won the Olympic title in 2008 and 2012, had two World Time Trial titles to her name and won her fourth US National Time Trial title after coming out of retirement in 2015 – eight years after her last success. She may have been 43-years-of-age the day after the Rio race, but with age came experience. Having retired after Beijing, and for a second time after London, it was another comeback for the American as she sought Olympic title number three. Linda Villumsen of New Zealand and Lisa Brennauer of Germany were the 2015 and 2014 World Time Trial Champions respectively and offered a serious challenge to Armstrong. Villumsen had six World titles to her name.
There were no changes in the format since London 2012, with the 25 starters setting off at 90-second intervals over the 29.7 km circuit which started from Tim Maia Square in Pontal, west Rio de Janeiro. After a 2.5 km ride on the flat, the riders entered the 24.7 km Grumari circuit, which they completed one lap of before the ride back to the starting point.
As expected, Armstrong set the early pace on a rainy day in Pontal, leading through the first split, just less than five seconds ahead of the Italian Elisa Longo Borghini, the daughter of the Olympic cross country skier Guidina Dal Sasso, with the Netherlands rider Anna van der Breggen, the 2015 World Championship runner-up, in third place. Van der Breggen and Longo Borghini had finished first and third respectively in the Rio road race just three days earlier.
Up from sixth to first place at split two was Russia’s London 2012 bronze medallist Olga Zabelinskaya, the daughter of the 1980 Olympic road race champion Sergey Sukhoruchenkov. Armstrong was 2.88 seconds behind in second place with the Italian Longo Borghini a further 4.1 seconds adrift in third.
It was a case of too little too late for the 2014 World Champion Lisa Brennauer who, despite the fastest time in the final phase could only finish a lowly eighth, while Armstrong clawed back Zabelinskaya to overtake her at the top of the leaderboard and beat the Russian by 5.55 seconds to take her third consecutive Olympic gold medal whilst van der Breggen ousted Longo Borghini to take the bronze medal. As she crossed the line, Armstrong was so exhausted after her final sprint, she collapsed. But she had vindicated her selection onto the US team which many had criticised at the time as she became the first female cyclist, track or road, to win the same event at three consecutive Olympics.
For Zabelinskaya, she raised her arms thinking she had secured gold as she crossed the line only to watch disappointingly as Armstrong deprived her of gold. Had the Russian won, that too would have been controversial as she had returned to the sport shortly before the Games following a drugs ban.

When Golovanov jerked 180.0 kg, he set a world record total of 487.5 kg to win gold in a big upset. Martin was never really close, but also lifted 180.0 kg in the clean & jerk to take silver, with Paliński getting bronze.

The eight heats were all won in modest times but in the final Sheppard posted a new world record of 1:52.8.  It is, however, probable that Kilpatrick had passed the 800 metres mark in a slightly faster time when he set his world record.  In anticipation of a fast Olympic final, a tape was also placed at 880 yards which Sheppard reached in 1:54.0.  After 400 metre splits of 53.0 and 59.8, it is evident that Sheppard was slowing considerably towards the end of the race but even so, a differential of 1.2 seconds to cover the additional 4.68 metres between 800 metres and 880 yards seems unrealistic.  Having won the 1,500 metres seven days earlier, Sheppard completed a notable middle distance double.
Melvin Sheppard would eventually win four gold medals in middle distance running at the Olympics.  In 1908 he won the 800, 1,500, and ran on the medley relay team, anchoring the 800 metre leg.  In 1912, he also ran on the 4 x 400 metre relay.  He eventually won five AAU titles over two laps - 1906-08, and 1911-12, and three Canadian titles - 1906, 1911-12.

Four players tied for third and a full 18-hole playoff was held to determine places 3-6. In fact, George Thorne and Mackenzie Turpie tied again in the playoff with nets of 84, and we think they played off again to determine places 4 and 5.
Lambert also competed in the Olympic competition, finishing eighth with rounds of 94-95.  He was from St. Louis and when Olympic golf returned to St. Louis in 1904, Lambert would again compete, making him the only person to play in both Olympic golf tournaments.  In fact, Lambert was the man responsible for the 1904 Olympic golf event.
Lambert was a wealthy man.  He founded Lambert Pharmacal Co., later Warner-Lambert, best-known as the makers of Listerine.  His avocation in later years became flying and he was the primary benefactor for Charles Lindbergh’s trans-atlantic flight.  For his contributions to aviation, the St. Louis airport was named Lambert International Field.
In 1900 Lambert played the Olympic golf event while on a business trip to his Paris office.  On his return he mentioned the Olympic golf event to his father-in-law, Colonel George McGrew.  McGrew was the founder of Glen Echo Golf Club in St. Louis and with the Olympics coming to St. Louis in 1904, Lambert and McGrew put forth plans to conduct an Olympic golf tournament at Glen Echo.

At the halfway point the expected victory seemed a formality as the East Germans built up a sizeable lead. 
It was the third run that was to prove decisive and while Hoppe’s crew had a nightmare run and finished halfway down the field, Switzerland I flourished under the veteran driver Ekkehard Fasser and moved from a distant third into a clear lead by producing the fastest time of the competition. Though the GDR crew gained some time back over the final run it was not enough to deny Fasser an unlikely victory in the final event of his career.
Despite the excitement of the chase for the championship more publicity was garnered by a team that did not complete the competition. The novelty of seeing the Jamaican flag painted on the side of an Olympic bob had already caused excitement worldwide but the events of the third run helped the story to become a major news event. Coming too late out of the Kreissel curve the Jamaican bob overturned and slid down the track with the crew members’ helmets scraping the ice wall. Thankfully the team were unhurt in the accident and the sight of the quartet walking across the finish line alongside their bobsleigh was beamed to millions across the world.

At the World Championships in Davos, which had been held little more than a week before this Olympic contest, he had bettered Oscar Mathisen’s 14-year-old World Record of 43,4 by three tenths of a second. This record had not brought him the world title, which was taken by Clas Thunberg, a triple Olympic champion in Chamonix. Finn Thunberg, bronze medallist four years earlier, was also a contender in the shortest event, as were the other Norwegians: Haakon Pedersen, Oskar Olsen and Bernt Evensen.
The North Americans were somewhat of an enigma to the Europeans. They had skated in Norway, but only against second-rate Norwegians or on imperial distances. The first pair of the 500 m, with John O’Neil Farrell (USA) and Oskar Olsen (NOR), immediately showed what they were capable of. Farrell clocked 43.6, a new Olympic Record. The next race saw the two biggest title contenders pitted against each other. Roald Larsen took the early lead over Clas Thunberg, but the World Champion gained on the World Record holder in the back straight, making for an exciting sprint on the final 100 m. Thunberg won in an excellent time of 43.4, while Larsen equalled Farrell’s time. Haakon Pedersen went below 44 in the following race, but was already out of medal contention. The next big fight was between the two remaining Norwegians, Evensen and Olsen. The latter skated poorly, but 1927 World Champion Evensen went all out and stopped the watches at 43.4 - identical to Thunberg’s mark.
Finland’s Jaakko Friman, an outsider who had won the Finnish selection race for the Olympics, then also skated 43.6, making for two first place skaters, and three in third position. The last potential medallist was Charlie Gorman of Canada. He skated against Kos (NED), who fell in the first curve. Gorman, who finished 7th in the 43.9 claimed he was obstructed by his opponent’s fall. His protest was disallowed by the jury, which angered Gorman so much he withdrew from the 5000 m held later that same day. The Dutchman did re-skate, albeit out of competition. Kos’s 47.5 would have ranked him an ex aequo 21st. He was also unlucky in his other Olympic races, falling in both the 1500 m and 5000 m.
After the final pair, some of those in attendance expected tie-breaks for the title and third place, which was fairly common in those days. However, the rules did not allow for such a race and the result stood. It was the first time a gold medal was shared at the Winter Olympics. Evensen’s co-championship was the first speed skating gold for Norway.

The International Hockey Federation was initially opposed to this, but the Canadians claimed they would be unable to offer quality natural grass pitches for the entire tournament. Nowadays, all international matches are played on artificial surfaces. The number of participating nations had been cut back from 16 to 12, and was further reduced when Kenya joined the African boycott. Great Britain had lost to Belgium for the final qualifying position. Ghana was the next African team after Kenya, but they had played very poorly in qualifying so Britain was offered the spot when Kenya announced they would withdraw. However, Kenya did not notify the IOC of their withdrawal in time so the Fédération Internationale de Hockey (FIH) elected to play the tournament with only 11 teams. The British team was actually at Heathrow Airport when they heard the news, preparing to leave for Montreal, but they had to return to their homes.
The tournament had many upsets. 1975 World Champion India did not make the semi-finals, and neither did defending Olympic Champion West Germany. Oceanian nations Australia and New Zealand did make the cut, along with hockey powerhouses Pakistan and the Netherlands. The latter team had been unbeaten in pool play, and heavily underestimated their semi-final opponents, New Zealand. After three overtime periods, the Kiwis scored the winning goal from a penalty corner. The other country from “down under”, Australia, also upset their opponents 2-1, to make for a completely unexpected final line-up. This was even more surprising as the artificial turf was assumed to be an advantage to technically superior teams. The final was a rather boring affair, with Tony Ineson scoring the only goal on a penalty corner.

This event was considered open as no gymnast had been dominant in recent years. One medalist returned from 1992 and that was American Shannon Miller, who had also won the 1994 World Championships. Miller had won five medals in Barcelona and was the best gymnast in the world in 1993-94, winning the all-around world title both years, but injuries had made her less formidable. Still she won gold on the beam in Atlanta, the first individual gold medal by an American gymnast at a modern non-boycotted Olympics. She was trailed by the gold and silver medalists from the all-around, Ukrainian Liliya Podkopaieva and Romanian Gina Gogean.

Team/individual competitions held concurrently.",na,"The team dressage competition consisted of “passive scoring,” in which each team’s score was obtained simply by adding together the scores of their riders from the individual event. There were only three teams entered in the dressage competition – France, Sweden, and the United States – so they were all guaranteed medals. As French riders – Xavier Lesage and Charles Marion – had finished 1-2 in the individual event, France easily won the gold medal. Sweden won silver, led by Bertil Sandström, who originally placed second in the individual event. But Sandström was disqualified after protests from the French and Americans, who claimed he had made clicking noises to give instructions to his horse. Sandström claimed the noises were from a creaking saddle, but the protests was upheld and he was placed last individually. However, in what can charitably be called an unusual ruling, his score was allowed to count with no deduction for the team event, allowing Sweden to receive the silver medal.

The first run started in late afternoon and the second run was held as a night-race under floodlights. The current slalom World Cup season saw Mikaela Shiffrin winning three races in Levi, Bormio, and Flachau, while Marlies Schild won in Courchevel and Lienz, and Frida Hansdotter topped the result in the last race before the Olympics in Kranjska Gora. This brought Shiffrin in the lead of the standings followed by Hansdotter, Marlies Schild, and Marie-Michèle Gagnon. Marlies Schild was the 2011 World champion and also won the slalom World Cup in 2010/11 and 2011/12 with Shiffrin as  reigning 2013 World chamipon and 2012/13 slalom World Cup winner. With her 35th career win in Lienz, Marlies Schild also overtook Vreni Schneider in the list of all-time slalom World Cup wins. So all was focused on a generational duel between the young 18-year-old superstar Mikaela Shiffrin and 32-year-old grand dame Marlies Schild.
In the opening run the early skiers would post the fastest times. Going first, the pace was set by Bernadette Schild (AUT) with a time of 53.41. This didn’t last long as Super Combined champion and Vancouver slalom gold medalist Maria Höfl-Riesch (GER) overtook this with 53.11. Two skiers later Tina Maze (SLO), Giant Slalom champion, set a time of 53.29 to challenge the leaders. But easily the fastest was Mikaela Shiffrin (USA) who skied the course in 52.62 to take a lead of almost half a second into the second run. Coming next with bib number 7 was Marlies Schild, but she lost more than 1.3 seconds and finished the first run only in sixth position.
With the top 30 going in reverse order in the second run, Frida Hansdotter (SWE) had the fourth fastest time down the course to finish with a combined time of 1:45.90. Next down the course was Kathrin Zettel, seventh after the first run but powering to the second fastest time on the second run to take the lead with 1:45.35. Sixth after the first run, Marlies Schild (AUT) then set the new target time of 1:45.07, having posted the fastest time on the second run with 51.11. Maze then had a poor second run to finish in 1:46.25, ultimately placing eighth. As the course deteriorated Höfl-Riesch was relatively slow and her combined time of 1:45.73 finish fourth. Going last, Shiffrin, despite a mistake on the course, when she almost fell backwards and had to recover, held her nerve with the sixth fastest time of the run, winning gold over the two Austrians by a margin of 0.53 seconds.
Shiffrin became the youngest ever Olympic slalom champion and her idol Marlies Schild became the first women to win a third medal in the same Alpine skiing event after silver in Vancouver and bronze in Torino. Skiing manufacturer Atomic, who did not win a single medal before this event, made a clean sweep of the podium.

The Germans, Wilhelm Horn and Erich Hanisch had the advantage on paper, having won the European title in 1934. Together with the Austrians and the Dutch they formed the lead early on. Sweden (Sven Johansson and Erik Bladström) joined them halfway through the race, and attempted to pull away with the Germans, leaving Austria and the Netherlands to fight for the bronze. With one kilometre left, the leading boats were still level, leaving an exciting finish in front of the stands. The Swedes managed to pull away slightly at the end, crossing the line just three tenths ahead of the German boat. While the Swedish victory was somewhat of a surprise, Johansson and Bladström proved their status at the inaugural World Canoeing Championships in 1938, where they finished second in this event, behind another Swedish kayak.

Lara Ilchenko of Russia had won five successive world titles at 5 km and the last three over 10 km. The pattern of the race emerged at an early stage with the British pair of Cassie Patten and Keri-Anne Payne moving to the front of the pack and forcing the pace. The tactic worked to the point that only two others were able to follow. Ilchenko stayed on the shoulders of the leaders before unleashing her sprint with 110 metres to go. She sped clear to finish ahead of Payne with Patten edging Angela Maurer of Germany for the bronze medal. Natalie du Toit of South Africa finished in 16th position. Du Toit had represented her nation at the age of 14 but lost a leg in a motorcycle accident in 2001. She came to world attention by winning five titles at the 2004 Paralympic Games then in 2008 qualified for the Olympic Games by placing 4th at the World Championships.

He moved into first place after the second event, the javelin throw, and was never headed, placing first or second in four of the five events.  However, behind him, a great battle ensued for the other medals.  Everett Bradley (USA), Hugo Lahtinen (FIN), Bob LeGendre (USA), Helge Løvland (NOR), and Brutus Hamilton (USA) were separated by only three points on the point-for-place scoring system.
Bradley won the silver medal.  Lahtinen took the bronze medal in a tie-breaker with LeGendre in which the decathlon scoring tables were used.  Løvland again narrowly beat out Hamilton, this time for 5th place, and again the decathlon scoring tables were needed to break the tie.    In addition to his gold medal, Lehtonen was also awarded the Challenge Prize that had been donated by the King of Sweden.  In addition to his gold medal, Løvland was also awarded the Challenge Prize that had been donated by the Russian Emperor.
Points were re-scored after three events and four events so that only those athletes who went on to the next rounds were counted for the final scoring. Only 12 were supposed to advance to the fourth event, the discus throw, and only six were supposed to compete in the final event, the 1,500 metres. However, the competitors protested the Finnish competitors, Hugo Lahtinen and Ossian Nylund, so intially 14 athletes were allowed to go through to the fourth phase. Ole Reistad and [Edmond Médecin}() were tied aftyer the third event, the 200 metres, so eventually 15 athletes competed in the discus throw, and because of the protest against Lahtinen, Bertil Ohlson was allowed to run the 1,500 as a seventh competitor.

With only the English team failing to qualify from the World Cup’s quarter-finalists, the tournament had a high standard of play. As expected, Norway won its pool, but the other favourite, the US, was held to a draw by China and placed second on goal difference.
This pitted the two strongest women’s teams against each other in the semi-finals. After 90 minutes, both had scored once, and the match went into golden goal overtime. After just five minutes, Shannon MacMillan sent her team to the final. The China-USA rematch was a close affair watch by a record 76,000 crowd. Tiffeny Milbrett sealed the match with a second half goal. One of the most remarkable names in the tournament was the shirt name of Marileia dos Santos: Michael Jackson.

Unsurprisingly Limbach was the number one seed in London.
The opening rounds of competition passed off rather uneventfully but the round of 16 heralded the start of a massacre of the top seeded combatants. Recently crowned European champion Aleksey Yakimenko of Russia, #3 seed Gu Bon-Gil of Korea and former Olympic champions Aldo Montano and Zhong Man were all eliminated in quick succession.
This left Limbach as an even clearer favourite for the Olympic title but his hopes only lasted as far as his next contest where he was upset by the third string Russian Nikolay Kovalyov.
The foil event in London saw the full emergence of Asia and Africa as new powers in the sport but sabre remained true to its European heartland and the final was played out between representatives of Hungary and Italy, traditionally two of the historic powerhouses of sabre fencing.
Áron Szilágyi of Hungary and Italian Diego Occhiuzzi had been successful as individuals but their major championship medals had mostly been achieved in team events. At #6 and #14 in the rankings few would have predicted they would face other for the gold medal in London.
As a contest the Olympic final was over by the half way stage. The Hungarian showed a dazzling turn of speed to win 8 of the first 9 points and, try as he might; Occhiuzzi was unable to claw back the deficit.

The two pairs were not to meet again until the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Some people blamed Papadakis and Cizeron missing out on the gold medal in 2018 on a wardrobe malfunction in the rhythm program that left Papadakis’ breast exposed for the majority of the performance, but this time everything stayed in place and they wowed the judges and posted a world best score for the segment. In the free program the American duo of Madison Hubbell and Zach Donohue kept their grasp on the bronze medal over teammates Madison Chock and Evan Bates despite a deduction for exceeding the time limit for a hold.
Although the Russians performed well, Papadakis and Cizeron were marginally better and extended their winning margin when skating to French composer Gabriel Faure’s “Requiem”. They emulated Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat’s victory for France in the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City.

Marita Lange led in round one with 18.78 (61-7½) and held that until Gummel threw a world record 19.07 (62-6¾) in round three. That settled first and second but Gummel had a stunner in round five, throwing 19.61 (64-4) for a huge world record. The medals were the same as at the 1966 Europeans and the three would repeat that in 1969, with the same order as in 1966, Chizhova winning.

As Szabo prepared for her final routine, a power failure in Pauley Pavilion put the lights out and her routine was delayed for eight minutes.

He was the world record holder, had won the 2011 World Championships, and had been world-ranked #1 in the event in 2009-11. He had not aimed for a world record in London, but simply wanted to set a fast pace to make it as difficult as possible for the other runners. Rudisha took the lead in the final from the break, passing 200 metres in 23.5 and the 400 in 49.28. Sudanese rival Abubaker Kaki was close, trailing at the bell in 49.4, as was Mohammed Aman (ETH) in 49.5 and Nijel Amos (BOT) in 49.7. Rudisha did not slow down, running 25.02 for the third 200 to pass 600 in 1:14.30, ahead of his paces in his two world record efforts. Kaki was destroyed by his attempt to stay close, as he would drop back to seventh. But Rudisha kept after it, crossing the line in 1:40.91, another world record, and the first 800 ever run under 1:41.
Rudisha towed the other runners to the greatest 800 metre race in history, based on times. Every finalist except Kaki set a PR, and places 2-8 all set best-for-place records. The silver went to Amos in 1:41.73, making him the third fastest ever over two laps, with Rudisha’s teammate Timothy Kitum coming home for bronze in 1:42.53, a mark better than the previous Olympic record of 1:42.58 set in 1996 by Norwegian Vebjørn Rodal. Amos had recently won the 2012 World Junior title, but Kitum was even younger at only 17-years-old and became the youngest ever medalist in the Olympic 800. Amos’ medal was the first ever for Botswana.
Rudisha said later that he thought of his father, Daniel, at the starting line. Daniel Rudisha had anchored Kenya to a silver in the 4×400 at the 1968 Olympics, and Rudisha noted, “He has always been my role model.” London Organizing Committee chairman Sebastian Coe, himself twice a world-record setter in the 800, noted, “It was the most extraordinary piece of running I have probably ever seen. It was the performance of the Games, not just of track & field, but of the Games. Rudisha’s run will go down in history as one of the greatest Olympic victories.”

This was not well received by Matos or his coach, Leodis González, who vociferously protested the call. Matos then kicked Chelbat in the face before he had to be escorted out by security. Matos’s disqualification was upheld, and he and his coach were further given lifetime bans from the sport for their behavior.
After that episode the final was anticlimactic. Nikolaidis took an early lead, but Cha evened the match in the final round and then won the gold medal with a late kick.

Schenk was the greatest all-around skater in the world, and was trying to win four gold medals in the four speed skating events, to duplicate the feat of Lidiya Skoblikova in 1964, but he was a longshot in the 500.
In the first pair Sweden’s Hasse Börjes posted an Olympic record of 39.69, which was considered a formidable time. But Keller bettered it in the third pair, finishing in 39.44, and these two would eventually win the gold and silver medals, as Keller defended his title.

For Schoeman, it was the first podium finish of his career and he had the distinction of being the first African triathlete to win an Olympic medal.
But the lasting memory of a magnificent men’s contest was the two British brothers lying side-by-side on the ground after crossing the finishing line congratulating each other as they improved on their 2012 performance of gold and bronze, which they had now upgraded to gold and silver, with Alistair becoming the first triathlete to win back-to-back Olympic golds.

Shockingly, no American long jumper qualified for the final. Previously, save for the 1980 boycott, no Olympic long jump had been contested without an American on the medal stand, much less in the final. The favorite in the event was Panama’s Irving Saladino and although he struggled in the qualifying, barely getting through, he did not disappoint in the final. The first round lead was taken by Zimbabwe’s Ngoni Makusha with 8.19 (26-10½), but Saladino took the lead in round three with 8.21 (26-11¼). South Africa’s Geoffrey Mokoena jumped 8.24 (27-0½) early in round three to take the lead, but Saladino then popped the winning jump of 8.34 (27-4½) later in that round. In the final round, Cuba’s Ibrahim Camejo went 8.20 (26-11) to secure the bronze medal.

The Scandinavian nations, however, were considered as having the strongest crews in the sport, particularly Sweden, who sent Hans Berglund and Lennart Klingström to the 1948 Summer Olympics. Berglund had won a silver medal in the K-2 1000 at the 1938 World Championships. The opening heats were won by Finland’s Ture Axelsson and Nils Björklöf, who had taken bronze in the K-2 10000 the previous day, and Denmark’s Ejvind Hansen and Bernhard Jensen. The final came down to a sprint between Denmark and Sweden, which the latter won by only 0.2 seconds. Finland, meanwhile, had come in third, while the Hungarian duo of Kálmán Blahó and János Urányi, who had seemed well-positioned to take a medal, were disqualified for “hanging” in the wash of another kayak, which was forbidden by the International Canoe Federation. This incident was downplayed in the Official Report, which claimed “over a short distance under conditions which permit only a minimum space between craft, it is possible to give the appearance of ‘hanging’ when innocent of any such intent.”

In the absence of the Dutchman, European hopes rested with the British boxer, Don Scott and Scott, despite suffering from an injured nose, moved into the final to the home crowd’s evident pleasure. The other finalist would be George Hunter of South Africa, a boxer who had fought through a difficult draw with a series of impressive performances. The final was closely contested and both fighters were praised for their efforts but there was no doubting that Hunter had won South Africa’s second boxing of the Games. Hunter would also be awarded the Val Barker Trophy as the outstanding and most stylish boxer of the Games.
There was an unfortunate end to the bronze medal box-off when Australia’s Adrian Holmes suffered a broken ankle after being knocked to the canvas against Mauro Cia and was wheeled out of the arena. Cia would go on to a brief career in Argentine movies. America’s Chuck Spieser lost in the last sixteen but would be the more successful in the pro ranks; he fought a final eliminator for the world title.

It was therefore natural that the two Italian bobs would assume the mantle of favourites at the 1964 Games. Italy I was driven by reigning world champion Sergio Zardini  whilst Eugenio Monti in Italy II had added the 1960 and 1961 world titles to his numerous successes in the two man championships. Other contenders for the gold included Austria I, who had placed third in the 1963 World Championships, 1962 champions West Germany and the Great Britain bob piloted by two man champion Tony Nash.  The wild cards of the event were Canada I who had not challenged for a medal when the World Championships visited Igls twelve months earlier but had shown a steady improvement over the previous few seasons.
That Canada led after the first run was a surprise but the fact that they shattered the track record and finished nearly half a second clear of the field was a sensation. Expectations were still that the Italians would take over at the top of the leader board but they continued to falter and Canada increased their lead on the succeeding three runs. Austria I overtook Italy II for silver after the third run and held on narrowly to the medal at the conclusion of the event with a margin of just 0.12 seconds. The Canadian victory may not have been possible without the generosity of Eugenio Monti as the Italian had provided the use of his own mechanics to repair a rear axle on the Canadian bob during the competition.
Vic Emery, the pilot of the victorious Canadian bob, was travelling through Europe in the winter of 1956 when he hitched a lift with a truck carrying equipment for the British bobsleigh team en route to the Winter Olympics. Captivated by the events in Cortina he returned to Montreal and became a pioneer of the sport in Canada. His Olympic victory came just five years after he had driven his nation’s first ever entry at world championship level and was achieved despite a perceived lack of enthusiasm from the Canadian sporting authorities and the lack of a bob run in his home country. Emery and the Canadians proved their success was no fluke by adding the 1965 world title to their Olympic victory before retiring at the end of the season.

However, a few days earlier, he had become the first Italian ever to win an Olympic swimming title when he secured a shock victory in the 100 metres breaststroke.
The momentum of his victory carried on to the 200 and his winning time of 2:10.67 was the second fastest time in history behind Mike Barrowman’s gold medal winning swim at the 1992 Olympic Games. By winning the 200 Fioravanti became the first man ever to complete the double of taking both breaststroke gold medals at the same Olympics.
The silver medallist was Terence Parkin of South Africa, who had completely deaf since birth. Since he was unable to react to a starting gun, a strobe light was installed as a replacement.

Ryun had run at the 1964 Olympics while only a high schooler, but since the Tokyo Olympics, he had broken the mile world record, running 3:51.3 on 17 July 1966 at Berkeley, California. Then at the 1967 AAU Meet, he bettered that with 3:51.1. In July 1967 a dual meet between the USA and the British Commonwealth was planned in Los Angeles. Running for the Commonwealth team was Kenya’s Kip Keino, who was felt to be the best miler in the world, after Ryun. At that event, Ryun and Keino raced over 1,500 metres and Ryun shattered the field and world record with 3:33.1, Keino over four seconds behind. Ryun was felt to be unstoppable.
But the Olympics were in 1968, not 1966 or 1967, and they were held at the altitude of Mexico City. Further, early in 1968, Ryun fell ill with a mild case of mononucleosis which affected his training. He trained in Flagstaff, Arizona to try to acclimatize to altitude but his weakness from the mono made that difficult. Still he made the US Olympic team, and he had been so dominant in 1966-67 that he was considered a slight favorite for the 1,500. Ryun and Keino both passed thru to the final, but another important runner was also there, Keino’s Kenyan teammate, Ben Jipcho. Not considered a medal contender, Jipcho and Keino planned a strategic race trying to weaken Ryun’s deadly kick. Jipcho passed 400 metres in a suicidal 56.0 with Keino on his shoulder in 56.6. Ryun ran in third but was well back and the pace was felt to be far too fast for the 2,200 metre altitude. But Keino pushed on, taking the lead at 800 in 1:55.3. Ryun was 30 metres back. Keino ran his third lap in 58.1, passing 1,200 in 2:53.4, faster than world record pace. Nobody could keep up that pace, it was felt, but Ryun and the field were now so far behind that the race was over. Keino held on to win in an Olympic record 3:34.91, considered unreachable in that thin air. Ryun did win the silver medal, 25 metres back.

The tournament then proceeded on a single-elimination basis. No nations were making their début at Olympic hockey, and no one team had been dominant since the previous Olympics. Arguably the favourites were Australia and Belgium, each of whom had topped the FIH world rankings in recent years. Argentina, the reigning Olympic champions from 2016, had since slipped down the world rankings and were not considered amongst the favourites to retain their title.
In Pool A, Australia comfortably qualified at the top of the group; the only match they did not win was their last match against Spain (1-1), when they had already qualified for the elimination rounds. India finished second in the group, despite losing 7-1 to Australia. Reigning Olympic champions Argentina along with Spain were the other qualifiers, Argentina defeating New Zealand 4-1 to qualify in their final pool match.
In Pool B, Belgium was equally as dominant, only failing to win their last match against Great Britain (2-2) when both teams had already qualified for the elimination stage – Belgium winning the group and the British team finishing third. Germany finished as runners-up in the group, while the Netherlands was the final qualifier.
The quarter-finals were mostly comfortable contests, Germany defeating the reigning champions Argentina by a score of 3-1, with similar score lines for Belgium against Spain and India against Great Britain. The only close contest was between Australia and the Netherlands with the scores finishing 2-2 at full-time, Australia going on to win the shootout by a score of 3-0.
Belgium defeated India 5-2 in the first of the semi-finals. Loick Luypaert put Belgium ahead with an early goal, but India fought back to lead 2-1 at the end of the first quarter, Harmanpreet Singh and Mandeep Singh scoring the goals. Belgium came back strongly with three goals from Alexander Hendrickx (2 penalty corners and one penalty stroke) followed by a late goal from John-John Dohmen, although it wasn’t until the final quarter that Belgium exerted their dominance.
The second semi-final was a much closer affair. Australia opened the scoring through Tim Brand, but Germany quickly equalised with a penalty corner converted by Lukas Windfeder. Australia retook the lead in the second quarter through Blake Govers, who converted a penalty corner. Although Germany pressed for an equaliser, it was Australia who scored a third goal from Lachlan Sharp in the closing minutes when Germany had taken off their goalkeeper, as Australia advanced to the final, winning by 3-1.
In a thrilling match for the bronze medal, India won their first medal since 1980 when they defeated Germany 5-4. Timur Oruz opened the scoring for Germany after 2 minutes, but in the second quarter Simranjeet Singh equalised for India. Two quick goals from Niklas Wellen and Benedikt Fürk saw Germany take a 3-1 lead, but two goals from penalty corners by Hardik Singh and Harmanpreet Singh saw India level the score. In the third quarter Rupinder Singh put India ahead with a penalty stroke, and Simranjeet Singh scored a fifth goal for India shortly afterwards. Lukas Windfeder scored for Germany at the start of the final quarter, but although they were dominant for the remainder of the match, Germany could not find the equalising goal.
The final was a tense affair between two closely matched teams, each team’s defence largely being in command. Belgium finally broke the deadlock when Florent van Aubel scored in the third period, only for Tom Wickham to equalise in the final quarter. So, a shootout was required, and it was the team from Belgium who won it 3-2 to claim their first ever gold medal in Hockey, an improvement on the silver medal they had won in 2016. Australia, for the fourth time, were defeated in an Olympic hockey final.

Both Kostadinova and Xiao had eliminated Wu Chia-Ying in a three-way shoot-off one round earlier. After 40 shots and winning two shoot-offs Xiao secured bronze. As the two remaining competitors Batsarashkina and Kim also tied after 50 shots, gold was also determined in a shoot-off, which was won by Batsarashkina 4-1. Batsarashkina won her second gold medal in Tokyo after having also won the 10 m air pistol, and followed Yang Qian as the second shooter to win two gold medals at these Games, but with her silver medal from the 10 m air pistol mixed team event, Batsarashkina became the most decorated shooter in Tokyo.

Amsterdam newspaper “De Telegraaf” noted that most players were of average quality and, due to the match being held outside of the korfball season, not in shape. This made the two 45-minute halves of the game quite an ordeal for the audience, especially since they had witnessed the first Dutch gold medal prior to the korfball session (in tandem track cycling), and were eagerly awaiting the award ceremony (medals weren’t handed out until the final day of the Olympics). Close to the end of the match, the audience decided to start the national anthem themselves, which indeed led to the actual ceremony being started, and the korfball players leaving the field quietly.

The United States had never won an Olympic medal in Nordic combined prior to the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, but Johnny Spillane, Bill Demong, and Todd Lodwick had all been in the World Cup top 10 during the season and Spillane had already won silver in the normal hill event. But at the 2009 World Championships, Lodwick had won the normal hill and mass start events, with Demong winning the large hill event. Spillane was a former world champion, having won on the large hill in 2003. They likely would have won the 2009 team event at the Worlds, except that Demong was disqualified for forgetting to wear his bib in the jump.
Finland led the jumping, with the United States second, Austria third, and Japan fourth, but the Finnish skiers were not strong in cross-country, were not considered contenders for the gold medal, and they would drop back to seventh overall. The team event ski run began during a light snowstorm that increased in intensity throughout the race. The United States led after two legs of the run, but on the third leg, Austria’s Felix Gottwald put his team into a narrow lead over the Americans. On the final leg Austrian Mario Stecher and American Demong fought it out, exchanging the lead several times, but Stecher pulled away near the end to bring Austria the gold medal. Austria had the best overall ski time, followed by Germany, which pulled up for the bronze medal.

Neither Nykänen or Weißflog held the world title, that championship having been won by Czechoslovakia’s Jiří Parma in 1985 but  Nykänen would arrive at Calgary as the holder of the prestigious Four Hills tournament. Norwegian hopes were pinned on World Cup holder Vegard Opaas whilst the Austrian pairing of Andreas Felder and Ernst Vettori had been consistently amongst the world’s best since the last Olympic Games.
After the completion of the first round the leader board had a strange look to it. It may have been no surprise to find Nykänen in the gold medal position but the top fifteen included only one Austrian, no Germans from either side of the border and no Norwegians. Weißflog did make the lower region of the top twenty but Opaas, the top Norwegian, languished all the way down in twenty-sixth place. Czechoslovakian and Yugoslavian jumpers were the top performers on the first jump with the two nations combining to produce eight of the top thirteen at the half way mark.
Nykänen’s second jump was a copy of his first and no one could challenge the mastery of the twenty four year old Finn. If there was little drama in the challenge for the Olympic title the same could not be said of the other medals with less than a point covering the next three jumpers. Pavel Ploc maintained the excellent form he had shown on the World Cup circuit to narrowly place second ahead of his less well known team-mate Jiří Malec. While Nykänen’s feat was covered widely by the world’s press another jumper equaled him in terms of media coverage. Eddie Edwards was a British ski jumper who had only two years of jumping behind him and was, at 74 kg and wearing a thick pair of spectacles, an unlikely competitor. His two jumps, both of 55 m, were well behind even of those of the next-to-last jumper.

The man favoured to follow Balado as Olympic champion was a Russian, Aleksey Lyozin, who won the gold medal at the 1995 World Championships. The silver medallist at that championship, Vitali Klychko of Ukraine, was not to compete at Atlanta as he was kicked out of Ukrainian national team after failing a drug test. His replacement in the national team was his younger brother  Volodymyr who took full advantage of his unexpected opportunity.  Volodymyr Klychko defeated home favourite Lawrence Clay-Bey in his opening fight, demolished Swede Attila Levin, then upset Lyozin to reach the final where he was to face the most surprising finalist of the entire tournament. Paea Wolfgramm of Tonga was Oceanian champion and had won a medal at the 1994 Commonwealth Games but these honours were won against weak opposition and few thought that he would survive past his first bout in Atlanta. He won his first fight against future professional world champion Sergey Dukhovich then pulled off one of the great upsets in Olympic boxing by outpointing Cuba’s Alexis Rubalcaba.  Wolfgramm produced another upset win in the semi-final to ensure that his nation’s first Olympic medal would either be gold or silver.
For a brief period in the final it seemed as though the impossible was about to happen as the Tongan kept pace with Klychko but the fitness level of the Ukrainian began to tell and he pulled away in the final round to record the victory. After the fight it was revealed that Wolfgramm had suffered a fractured wrist in his previous bout.
Throughout Tonga there were mass celebrations in honour of their first Olympic medallist and the King declared a national holiday for the day of Wolfgramm’s return home. He later had a career in professional boxing though he met with only modest success.
In contrast, Volodymyr Klychko won the WBO world professional heavyweight title in 2000 and held it for 2½ years before losing it to Corrie Sanders. He won the IBF title in 2006 and has since added the WBA and WBO titles to his collection in a reign that stretched through 2013. He is generally accepted as the leading heavyweight of the 21st century. The only other legimate claimaint to that honour may well be his brother, Vitali, who has also held a version of the world title for a large part of the decade.

The race started and at 8 AM at the North Curve of the Avus motor racing circuit, with the finish line drawn there as well.  The course was an out-and-back one over relatively flat roads, and it was not difficult enough to break apart most of the peleton. There were a number of crashes during the race. Many riders used the innovative three-speed bikes, but several of the Peruvian riders had trouble controlling their bikes with these and caused at least one major crash. Some 40 riders sprinted for victory in the final metres, with France’s Robert Charpentier defeating his countryman Guy Lapébie by a bike length. They led the French team to an easy victory in the team road race. Behind them, the German officials had trouble placing the remaining cyclists, and a large group of cyclists was placed in 16th position. There was another large crash only a few yards from the finish line, which took down about 20 riders, several of whom could not finish.
Charpentier had been runner-up at the 1935 World Championships.  He turned professional but with little success, and his career was interrupted by World War II. Lapébie fared better as a pro, finishing third in the 1948 Tour de France, and competing thru 1952. His older brother, Roger Lapébie, was a well-known pro, and won the 1937 Tour de France.

The target area for sabre was reduced from the whole body to “toutes les parties du corps, situées au-dessus de la ligne horizontale passant par la fourche” (“all body parts, located above the horizontal line passing through the crotch”) which seems to mean that touches to the lower torso and hips were valid but touches to the legs were not. It was only after the First World War that the modern sabre target was adopted. Standings in the pools were based on the greater number of victories, then by the greater number of touches scored, and finally by the fewest number of touches received.
In 1908 at London, Hungary began their dominance of Olympic sabre fencing.  They won the team event, and Jenő Fuchs won the individual sabre gold medal.  Fuchs was back in Stockholm, the leader of a powerful Hungarian sabre team.  Seven of the eight finalists were Hungarian, and Fuchs defended his Olympic gold medal.
From 1908 through 1964 a Hungarian fencer always won the sabre gold medal at the Olympics, with the exception of 1920, when Hungary was not invited as they were considered an aggressor nation in World War I.  Hungarians also won all the world championships in individual sabre from 1923 through 1937 and, after World War II, 1951-55.

The effect of high-altitude on athletic performance was known from previous competitions. In sprints and short-distance races, it produced record performances, but at distances, the thin air, with lesser oxygen content, impeded the athletes, and resulted in very slow competitions. No event in 1968 would be more affected by the altitude than the marathon.
The two-time defending champion, Abebe Bikila, was back and since he had grown up in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at higher altitude than Mexico City, he should have been a favorite. But he was injured, having recently had an appendectomy and was running the race with a stress fracture. He would not finish.

First medal contender to hit the ice was Gerard Kemkers, bronze medalist in the 5,000 m. In lap five, he fell - unusual for a 10,000 m. Despite a quick recovery, he lost about 10 seconds. While that was still enough to beat the Olympic Record at that point, the fall almost certainly cost him a medal. The first to beat Kemkers’ time was his compatriot, Leo Visser. The silver medalist in the 5,000 m, he had beaten 14 minutes a month earlier at the Dutch distance championships. This time, Visser ended at 14:00.55, which seemed insufficient for the title. This was soon proven by Austrian skater Michael Hadschieff. He had earlier medalled in the 1,500 m, and stood out in Calgary for having a red extension of his suit cap over his eyes. This was to protect his contact lenses from the dry Calgary air. Less visible was a plastic board he wore under his suit to improve aerodynamic profile. This apparently worked, as Hadschieff, who had earlier lost the 1988 European Championship bronze because of a poor 10,000 m, now skated a new personal best of 13:56.11 to take the lead. With Geir Karlstad falling out of contention after 7km, this left only Gustafson to beat Hadschieff. But the Swede was clearly faster, eventually winning by 8 seconds, the largest victory margin of his three Olympic titles. It was long uncertain if he would also be able to beat Karlstad’s world record. In the end, he managed it by three tenths.
Another remarkable competitor was Yoshiyuki Shimizu of Japan. While he finished only 28th out of 32 competitors, he did impress onlookers by re-tying the laces of one of his skates, while continuing to race.

The five-time Olympic champion and winner of 11 Olympic medals had planned to retire after her fifth Olympics but was hoping to go out with another gold medal in her top event. Having won 26 World Cups, five world titles and two Olympic golds in the 1,500 m, defending champion Wüst was undeniably one of favorites. Her main challenger was considered to be Japan’s Miho Takagi, the 2018 silver medalist who had won all three 1,500 m World Cups in the 2021/22 season she contested. The fourth World Cup was won by Brittany Bowe, also the 2015 world champion, while surprise 2021 champion Ragne Wiklund was considered an outsider for the gold.
ROC’s Yevgeniya Lalenkova, world bronze medalist in 2021, produced the first 1:55 time of the day, with 1:55.74, which was soon improved by Marijke Groenewoud, a surprise qualifier for the Dutch team. In pair 11, that time was narrowly beaten by Antoinette de Jong with 1:54.82. De Jong had beaten Wüst to the European title in January, but Wüst wasn’t going to have that happen in Beijing. After opening in 25.51 (same as De Jong), she managed to keep her speed throughout the end, gradually building up a lead of 1.5 seconds and beating the Olympic Record with 1:53.28. That left three Dutch skaters in the lead with three pairs to go.
World Cup leader Ayano Sato matched the splits of De Jong, but crossed the finish line a tenth of a second later, just ahead of Groenwoud. In pair 14, Bowe and Wiklund both disappointed, with Bowe’s laptimes blowing up after a fast start, and Wiklund just never picking up sufficient speed. That left only Takagi and Yelizaveta Golubeva. The Japanese favorite had the fastest opening of the day but lost to Wüst in both subsequent laps. At the bell, she trailed the Dutchwoman by only 0.03, but her final lap was slightly worse, reaching 1:53.72 at the finish line.
Wüst’s sixth speed skating gold matched the record of Soviet Russian Lidiya Skoblikova, and improved her total number of speed skating medals to 12 (she would win a 13th in the team pursuit), confirming her status as both the most successful Olympic speed skater as well as that of most successful Dutch Olympian (regardless of season).

With 29 athletes from 13 countries competing for the medals, one of the biggest favorites, Switzerland’s Iouri Podladtchikov, was a scratch after the first training due to health reasons. But this still left one of the deepest fields ever in the Olympic history of the event, promising a terrific showdown for one of the most televised medal events of the Games.
Amongst those left fighting for the podium was two-time Olympic champion, the American legend Shaun White and Japan’s Ayumu Hirano, silver medalist at the 2013 X-Games (becoming the youngest medalist in X-Games history at 14) and 2014 Olympic Winter Games.
The halfpipe final was comprised of four Americans, three Japanese, two Australians, two Swiss and one Finn. White, who had set a high bar in qualifying with a best score of 98.50 points, would need that advantage going into the finals and dropping in last, knowing what he had to do to beat his rivals.
The first runs of the halfpipe final saw several snowboarders falling, with Japan’s 16-year-old Yuto Totsuka taking a major crash, requiring him to be removed from the pipe on a stretcher for medical attention.
Australia’s Scotty James, came out strong on his first run, scoring 92.00 points. With his second run, 19-year-old Hirano staked a claim to the podium with an impressive comeback, having fallen on his first run earning only 35.25 points and in 10th place. With Hirano landing back-to-back double cork 1440s, White then set a record of 97.75 points for the highest score in the Olympic men’s halfpipe final. The back-to-back combination of 1440-degree tricks that White executed in his final run was the first time he’d ever done that. Both Hirano and James fell in their third and final run.
White became the first snowboarder to win three Olympic gold medals, his first coming 12 years previous at Torino 2006 and second at Vancouver 2010 (he was fourth at Sochi 2014). His 2018 title marked the 100th Olympic Winter Games gold medal for the United States.
Hirano was denied Olympic gold by the 31-year-old veteran White by less than 2.50 points and won his second career Olympic silver medal.  In winning the bronze medal, James who was Australia’s youngest male Olympian in 2010 in 50 years, won Australia’s second medal in PyeongChang.

The Soviets controversially held out 400 gold medalist Viktor Markin in the opening round, instead running Viktor Burakov. But Buryakov developed a mysterious injury before the final, allowing Markin to run. The final was quite close throughout with no more than 1-2 metres separating the USSR and the GDR. The GDR actually had a narrow lead at the bell, and their anchor was run by Volker Beck, gold medalist in the 400 hurdles. But Markin ran him down on the final lap, and won by slightly over a metre.

Looking at the World Cup season, wins had been recorded by the Dutch twins Ronald Mulder and Michel Mulder, the defending Olympic and world champion Mo Tae-Beom, Japanese skaters Keiichiro Nagashima and Joji Kato, while there had been surprise victories from Artyom Kuznetsov, Tucker Fredricks and Gilmore Junio.
While earlier skaters raced around the 35-second mark in the first heat, Jan Smeekens was the first to set a serious mark. His 34.59 in the 15th pair would prove the fastest time in the first race. It was most closely approached by Michel Mulder, the 2013 and 2014 World Sprint Champion, who lost just 0.04. Nagashima (34.79) and Mo (34.84) were further back, but still in contention, as were Kato and Ronald Mulder (both with 34.96).
In the 17th pair of the second heat, Ronald Mulder turned up the heat by finishing in 34.49, threatening his two leading compatriots with a time just 0.07 above the 2002 Olympic Record. Twin brother Michel couldn’t match that time, but with a displayed time of 34.71, he was fast enough to be ranked first, while Mo and Kato fell behind the Dutch brothers. Smeekens needed a finishing time of 34.72 to earn the gold - and despite a wide last turn, that is exactly what he skated. Assuming he had won, he began celebrating, but right at that time a correction of Mulder’s time came in. Probably due to a failing leg responder, his time was corrected by an unusual 0.04 margin, moving Mulder from 2nd to 1st within half a lap of Smeekens finishing. In the ensuing confusion, the referees reviewed their races in thousands of seconds, even though this is normally only done in case of ties. In the final ranking, therefore, Mulder was put at 69.312 and Smeekens at 69.324 - the smallest difference ever in the two-race event at the Olympics. The Dutch, who had never won a 500 m gold medal, now swept the event, their second medal sweep in just three days.

The USA won the initial gold medal at Nagano, but Canada had won the next four gold medals (2002, 2006, 2010, 2014). The two nations were similarly dominant in international play as they always finished 1-2 at the World Championships, held since 1990.
The United States seemed to have the upper hand in the years preceding PyeongChang, winning the World Championships in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The two nations played several friendlies in the intervening four years, with the USA also winning more than they lost. In the last few months before PyeongChang, however, Canada won several consecutive games, and the gold medal seemed to be a toss-up.
Eight nations qualified for the Olympic tournament; five of them did automatically by virtue of their ranking by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), two by a qualification tournament, and the Koreans as hosts (their first ever Olympic ice hockey tournament). The South Korean women had trained for several years, with an American coach and several Korean-American and Korean-Canadian players. Shortly before the Games, the IOC negotiated with DPR Korea (North) to allow them to participate and it was agreed that North and South Korea would field a combined, mixed women’s ice hockey team. The team would have 35 players, well above the 23 maximum, although only 22 would dress for each match.
Some of the South Korean players were unhappy, feeling that they would lose playing time. In the end, the mixed Korean team lost all its matches, although it acquitted itself well, and the international goodwill that the mixed Korean team generated made up for any untoward or hurt feelings. The two Koreas competing together on a playing field was historic for the Olympic Movement and the Korean Peninsula.
To avoid Canada and the USA dominating pool play by too great a margin, they were placed together in pool A, with Canada winning the pool when they defeated the Americans 2-1. The top two teams in pool A qualified for the semi-finals, with the third team and the top three teams from pool B facing each other in a knock-out round to advance to the semis. As expected Canada and the United States easily won their semi-final matches, both teams winning 5-0, over OAR and Finland, respectively.
The gold medal final was closely matched, with Canada taking a 2-1 lead after two periods. In the final period the United States’ Monique Lamoureux tied the match with 6:21 left and that score held through the end of regulation play. An overtime period ensued, but neither team could score, so they went to penalty shots. After four rounds that shoot-out was also tied at 2-2, when Monique’s twin sister Jocelyn Lamoureux-Davidson netted her shot, and when Meghan Agosta’s penalty shot was stopped by US goalie Maddie Rooney, the United States had finally won an Olympic gold, 20 years after their first and last one. The loss ended Canada’s record-setting Olympic winstreak of 24 games, but it took a classic to do it.
In the bronze medal game, Finland had a two-goal lead twice and held off the Russians (OAR) in the third period after they had narrowed the margin to one. Finland had now won three Olympic medals in women’s ice hockey, all of them bronze (Vancouver 2010, Nagano 1998).

It is one of the few Basque pelota events open to women, and the only one ever contested for women at the Olympic Games.
The top four nations of the 1990 World Championships qualified for the Olympic demonstrations in Barcelona, which included the Mexican champions Miriam Muñoz and Rosa María Flores. After a tough match against the Cuban women, the duo won all their matches with relative ease, beating Spain in the final.

Randori means “chaos taking” or “grasping freedom,” and is contrasted to the more structured practice of kata. Aikido was developed by Morihei Ueshiba to synthesize martial arts, philosophy, and religious beliefs. Aikido may be translated as “the Way of unifying (with) life energy” or as “the Way of harmonious spirit.” Sixteen (16) different shiai events were demonstrated at Tokyo in 1964 as part of the kendo demonstrations.

The heats of the 500 m immediately saw the exit of Charles Hamelin, who fell in his heat by his own error. Both Korean contenders were eliminated in the quarter-finals, as was Jean. This left An and Liang both making the final, where they were joined by Charle Cournoyer and Wu Dajing.
In an noisy Iceberg Skating Palace, Viktor An took the ice hoping to earn his second gold of the Games. But he had a slow start, and with just two laps to go he was still last. Then, Liang crashed out, and within a lap An first passed Courneyer and then Wu. An held on until the finish, claiming the gold. He had now won all four Olympic short track events at least once.

However, 30 skiiers started and only one did not finish – that being Chantal Bournissen, who had been the 1991 World Cup champion. Seizinger and Kronberger went off 10-11, and moved into first and second, respectively.

Park had already been lucky to avoid disqualification in his opening bout against Abdullah Ramadan of Sudan before he began a run of three close and controversial points decisions. In particular his quarter-final victory against Italy’s Vincenzo Nardiello drew criticism as most impartial observers believed the Italian was a deserving winner.
In contrast Roy Jones, Jr. had strolled past his opposition with a knockout and three decisive points decisions. His showboating style may have given offence for its’ supposed lack of respect for his opponents but none could deny his talent.
For the three rounds of the final, Jones appeared in complete control and most observers viewed the fight as a complete shutout for the American. The computer punch count recorded that Jones had landed nearly three times as many punches as Park (86-32). When the result was announced it was revealed that the Soviet and Hungarian judges had awarded the fight to Jones by four point margins but the other three had voted for the Korean. The decision was widely condemned as one of the worst in Olympic history and directly led to the introduction of electronic punch counters at the 1992 Olympic Games.
In 1997 the International Amateur Boxing Federation presented the IOC with information concerning allegations that some of the judges had received bribes at the 1988 Olympics. The IOC concluded that the charges were not proven. Unusually for a non-Olympic champion, Jones was awarded the Val Barker Trophy for best boxer of the Games.
Jones used the publicity gained in Seoul to start a lucrative career in the professional and emerged as one of the greatest boxers of the end of the 20th century. He won world titles at four different weights and became the first man for more than a century to win the world championship at middleweight, light-heavyweight and heavyweight.

The story of the early rounds was the showing of Aleksey Kiselyov of the Soviet Union. Kiselyov had moved up in weight from the middleweight division but had adapted well and was noted as a strong and aggressive fighter. The stocky Soviet accounted for Pietrzykowski in the semi-finals and was fully expected to use his strength to batter Pinto in the final. What happened next didn’t conform to expectations and instead the fight developed into a fairly negative affair. Two judges awarded the contest to the Italian by a single point whilst the other three had the two men level at 59 points apiece. Two of the tied judges awarded their preference to the Kiselyov but crucially the German judge opted for Pinto and the man from Novara was crowned Olympic champion. Pinto fought on as an amateur and retired in 1968 still only 25 years of age.

The high standard of qualifying set the stage for a dramatic final.
The current world record holder was Poland’s Artur Wojdat, who trained in the USA and had swum 3:48.38 earlier in 1988 at the US Nationals. In the final the early leader was Sweden’s Anders Holmertz followed by American Matt Cetlinski, the 1987 Pan Pacific champion.

Watabe was third after the ski jump, and Frenzel fifth, still very much in contention, with Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber in second place.

This left Romania’s Ivan Patzaichin and Bulgaria’s Borislav Ananiev, the 1973/1974 and 1975 bronze medalists respectively, as the only World Championship medalists competing in the event, which made the field in Montreal fairly open.
The opening heats were won by Yugoslavia’s Matija Ljubek and East Germany’s Wilfried Stephan, the latter of whom was representing the 1974 World runner-up nation. Ljubek’s feat, meanwhile, was even more impressive because he defeated Szegedi, Ananiev, Rogov, Patzaichin, and eventual silver medalist John Wood of Canada. Rogov, at least, was able to get revenge in the semi-finals, as he won his heat and bested Ljubek in the process, while the other heats went to Stephan and Szegedi. With such a strong and close field, most spectators expected an exciting finale, and the canoeists did not disappoint. As they approached the finish line, Ananiev, Ljubek, Rogov, Stephan, and Wood were all contenders for the gold medal, until the East German began to fall slightly behind. This left four Olympians for three podium spots and they all crossed the line within 0.69 seconds of each other. The top three, Rogov, Wood, and Ljubek in that order, were even closer, separated by only 0.37 seconds. Although Ljubek’s bronze might have been disappointing in consideration of his earlier performance, he would go to win the C-1 1000 and earn Yugoslavia its first two Olympic canoeing medals. Ananiev, meanwhile, would continue his unlucky streak by once again finishing just off the podium in that event.

They tried to alert the starter but he let the race start despite this.  The Canadians managed to start and were briefly in the lead but the other shoulder of the rigger failed and they were forced to row with only three oars.  The Swiss won the finals over the United States.  Switzerland had won the 1920 European Championship, and prior to the War, had won that title in 1911-1913.  France had won this event at the 1919 Inter-Allied Games, but no French crew competed in the coxed fours at Antwerp.

The winners in 1905-06 had been a four representing the Leander Club, so the final of this event brought the two top fours from Britain over the past few years. European championships in this era were only held for coxed fours, and Belgian and Italy dominated this class, but did not enter for the Olympics.
In the final, the Magdalen four opened at 38 strokes and was a length ahead at the half-way point. The Oxonian crew gradually increased their lead to win by a margin described variously as 1 or 2 lengths.
The silver and bronze medalists listed below are controversial. It seems likely that only gold medals, and no silver or bronze medals, were given. The rules, as given in the 1908 Official Report (p. 528), note, “The Winners or Winner of the events will each receive the British Olympic Council’s Gold Medal for the Olympic Games of 1908.”  And on another page of the 1908 Official Report (p. 37), one finds under Rowing, “Prizes: - Gold Olympic Medals to the winners in each Event.”  There is no mention of silver or bronze medals in either place. In the results section of the 1908 Official Report (p. 358). the four rowing events are listed, with only the winners listed under gold medals. No silver or bronze medal placements are listed.
Because of the set-up of the Henley course, only two crews or sculls competed at any one time. Thus the semi-finals and finals consisted of only two crews or single scullers. Certainly the losing finalist would seem to be considered the “silver medalist” although we do not know if those rowers actually received such a medal. In addition, it would seem natural, and consistent with other Olympic sports with head-to-head formats, such as boxing and tennis, to consider the losing semi-finalists as “bronze medalists.”
Olympic statisticians vary on the listing of these results. Erich Kamper, in Encyclopaedia of the Olympic Games, listed the losing semi-finalists in the single sculls and eights as finishing third, but he did not list the losing semi-finalists that way in the coxed pairs or coxed fours. Both Volker Kluge (Die Olympischen Spiele von 1896 bis 1980) and David Wallechinsky (The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics) consider all the losing semi-finalists as finishing in 3rd place. But in his more recent book, Olympische Sommerspiele: Die Chronik I, Kluge did not describe the losing semi-finalists as bronze medalists.
However, in keeping with our Guidelines (see Updates–>Guidelines), we have considered the losing finalists as silver medalists (2nd place) and both the losing semi-finalists as bronze medalists (3rd place). In those guidelines we note, “we consider all participants being placed first, second or third in the final standings to have received gold, silver or bronze medals respectively.”

Italian Andrea Cassarà had won the 2011 world title, defeating compatriot Valerio Aspromonte in the final in Catania. Cassarà was also ranked first in the FIE rankings, although Aspromonte was seeded first in the Olympic tournament. Third Italian on the squad was Andrea Baldini. He had missed the 2008 Games, after it was reported he had failed a drug test. He was cleared of the accusations several months later, immediately earning the World and European titles of 2009. Germany had entered defending champion, Benjamin Kleibrink, and the four-time World Champion, Peter Joppich. Earlier in the 2012 season, Lei Sheng had earned the Asian title, while European gold was claimed by Aleksey Cheremisinov, two months before the Olympics.
The first casualties fell in the round of 32, where Kleibrink was served revenge by Yuki Ota, who had lost the 2008 Olympic final to him. Joppich suffered defeat at the hands of Alaaeldin Abouelkassem, the 2010 Junior World Champion. Abouelkassem, son of an Egyptian father and Algerian mother, had suffered his father’s death just a few months before the Olympics, but this did not stop him from upsetting also Cassarà in the quarter-finals. Lei Sheng, a three-time World Championship medallist, took care of the other two Italians, outscoring Aspromonte in the quarter-finals, and Baldini in the semis. The Chinese and the Egyptian met in the final, where Lei took a 8-5 lead in the first period. Abouelkassem recovered to lead by two points at 13-11, but then received four touches in a row to give the title to Lei. With the bronze taken by Choi Byeong-Cheol of South Korea, the entire podium was taken by non-European fencers. This had not happened since 1904, when only Cuban and American foil fencers competed.

It was thought that the remaining podium spots would be determined between the Soviets and the Czechoslovakians, each of whom had won one silver and one bronze medal at the World Championships.
It was the Soviet Union, however, who had the fastest time in the opening round, defeating the East Germans in their heat by over three seconds. The Czechoslovakians, meanwhile, bested the nearest competitors in their heat, the West Germans, by over four seconds. The final soon developed into an affair between the Soviets and the East Germans, the latter of whom emerged victorious to capture the first Olympic gold medal in quadruple sculls, while the former settled for silver. As expected, the Czechoslovakians came in comfortably ahead of the West Germans for bronze.

The top two contenders were the East Germans, Wolfgang Gunkel, Jörg Lucke, and Klaus-Dieter Neubert, and the Czechoslovakians Vladimír Petříček and brothers Oldřich and Pavel Svojanovský, both of whom had won a European Championship since the last Olympics. The latter had been runners up at the 1971 Europeans, while the East Germans had were silver medalists at the 1970 Worlds, albeit with a different lineup. Lucke was already an Olympic champion, having won gold with Heinz-Jürgen Bothe in the coxless pairs in 1968. The reigning world champions were the Romanian trio of Ştefan Tudor, Ladislau Lovrenschi, and Petre Ceapura, the latter of whom had a bronze medal from the 1969 European Championships.
Czechoslovakia had the fastest time in the heats by far, while the other heats were won by the United States, East Germany, and the Soviet Union, who was the only nation within four seconds of the Czechoslovakian’s time. The Italians were eliminated in the repêchage, while the Soviets fought harder in the semi-finals, defeating Petříček and the Svojanovský brothers by just over half a second. In the final, however, it was East Germany that led the charge and captured gold a comfortable distance ahead of the Czechoslovakians, who settled for silver. The battle for bronze was more hard fought and went down to the line, where a photo-finish showed Romania beating out West Germany by 0.16 seconds. This meant that Romania had captured its first Olympic rowing medal, after two decades of participation.

The latter two skaters had also surprisingly finished 1-2 at the most recent World Sprint Championships, winning one 500 m race each.
After the first run, the winner already seemed certain. American Joey Cheek was the only skater to beat 35 seconds (34.82), and led with a huge margin of 4 tenths over Dmitry Dorofeyev. The fight for bronze was close, with Lee (35.34), Yuya Oikawa (35.35), Wotherspoon (35.37) and Yu (35.39) within 0.05 seconds of each other. World record holder Kato was back in 11th and out of medal contention.
The second run showed pretty much the same picture. Cheek was again the only one under 35 seconds (now with 34.94), and Dorofeyev consolidated his second place, despite being a bit slower than Lee. Cheek proved a popular Olympic champion, especially after he announced to give away his $25,000 award from the US Olympic Committee to charity (“Right to Play”, founded by Johann Olav Koss). Medals won by Dorofeyev and and Lee were the first speed skating medals for their countries since 1994 and 1992, respectively. Dorofeyev’s 2006 successes were a remarkable departure from his earlier results, having only a 1999 World Cup victory as a notable prior achievement.

Li also fell on his first vault, which ended his medal hopes, and he would place only seventh. Deferr performed two solid vaults and took the lead with 9.737. Romanian Marian Drăgulescu opened with his signature move, which bore his name, and scored 9.900, the highest score awarded at an Olympics or World Championships since 1995. On his second vault, however, he overshot his landing, going over the penalty stripe and touched down both hands to the mat. His score for that vault was 9.325, which seemed unusually high given that automatic deductions were required for his faults, and his average score of 9.612 brought him the bronze medal, trailing Deferr and Latvia’s Jevgēņijs Saproņenko.
Canada’s Kyle Shewfelt was fourth with 9.599, and they immediately protested after Drăgulescu’s second vault, stating that his score could not be that high with automatic deductions. There were five judges with the high and low scores eliminated. The other scores were required to be within 0.2 points of one another if the total was over 9.0. This was not true for Drăgulescu’s second vault, but the Canadian protest was brushed off by FIG Technical Director Adrian Stoica, who was also from Romania. Canada then lodged a protest with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but quickly withdrew it, realizing it had little chance of success.

The list of medal contenders appeared longer than for any previous Olympics. While the Central European powers were still strong, a new generation of drivers from outside the traditional bobsleigh zone were threatening to break through.  Gustav Weder had driven Switzerland I to the 1993 World Championship and the two-man event at Lillehammer and was a major medal threat but so were the German crews headed by Wolfgang Hoppe and Harald Czudaj, and Brian Shimer of the USA had taken the 1993 World Cup title. Shimer’s reign as title holder had been ended in 1994 by the brilliant young Canadian Pierre Leuders and also challenging the established powers were Great Britain.
Shimer, driving USA II, had a disastrous Olympics as a poor first run was followed by the ignominy of disqualification for having runners that were warmer than legally permitted. Lueders’ Canadians failed to spark and once again it was left to Germany and Switzerland to monopolise the podium.
Harald Czudaj had been a favourite at the 1992 Games but his preparations were ruined when it was revealed shortly before competition began that he acted as an informer for the Stasi, the East German secret police, for a number of years in the 80s in exchange for dropping a drunk-driving charge. Free from the worries of Albertville he was never headed though his lead was never more than 0.12 seconds throughout. Behind Czudaj’s Germany II bob came Weder’s Swiss world champions and the trio of medallists was completed by Wolfgang Hoppe piloted Germany I. This was Hoppe’s sixth and final Olympic medal and he retired with a tally of two gold, three silver and a bronze.
Jamaica’s appearance at the 1988 Olympics in Calgary had been considered a novelty but in Lillehammer they not only finished in the top half of the field but also defeated sleds from more traditional bobsleigh nations such as the United States, Italy and France. Last of the 29 finishers were the crew from Bosnia-Herzegovina who were competing just two years after the nation gained its’ independence and while fighting was still taking place in the country. The quartet was a multi-ethnic one comprising two Bosnian Muslims, an ethnic Croat and an ethnic Serb and competed using a sled donated by the Dutch.

Hardee had some concern in the javelin as he had had surgery in the past year on his throwing arm, but got the spear out to 66.65 and actually moved up closer to Eaton, but far from gold medal pace. Suárez rocketed the jav out to 76.94 and moved into third place. In the 1500 Eaton and Hardee ran safe paces, finishing with gold and silver, as Suárez hung on for the bronze medal.

Benvenuti won four bouts in Rome by unanimous decision to make the final against the Soviet Yury Radonyak, a relative unknown. Benvenuti knocked down Radonyak in the first round, but although the Soviet came back strongly, he would lose a majority decision, 4-1. For his victory, Benvenuti was awarded the Val Barker Trophy as the best boxer at the Rome Olympics. Benvenuti then turned professional and in 1967 defeated Emile Griffith to win the world welterweight title. He lost a re-match against Griffith, but they fought again in March 1968, with Benvenuti winning the rubber match. He then held the world title through November 1970 before losing it to Carlos Monzon. Benvenuti retired after losing a re-match to Monzon in May 1971, finishing with a career professional record of 82 wins, 7 losses, and 1 draw. He is considered by many boxing experts as Italy’s greatest ever fighter. After his boxing career ended he became a businessman and sports commentator, and then in 1995 travelled to India, renouncing the material world to volunteer at Mother Teresa’s Hospice.

Both had won three gold medals and four medals in Albertville, but Dæhlie was just starting his career and had by now surpassed his teammate. Ulvang had been second to him in the 1991-92 World Cup and third in the 1992-93 season. He was a three-time champion at Holmenkollen in the 50 km (1989, 1991-92), and he was renowned in Norway, having been chosen to speak the Oath of the Athletes at the Lillehammer Opening Ceremony, but the 1993-94 season had been difficult for him. In November 1993, Ulvang’s brother, Kjetil, had been skiing home when he got lost in a blinding snowstorm and disappeared. Over the next weeks and months, Vegard Ulvang stopped training and began looking for his brother. At one press conference before Lillehammer, his emotions burst forth when he tearfully told the press corps that after the Winter Olympics, he would go back to looking for Kjetil, “I will look for him and I will find him.” They did find Kjetil, but sadly at the bottom of a lake where he had apparently fallen in the blizzard conditions. Vegard Ulvang competed at Lillehammer but at less than his best, and was not entered in the 30 km.
But by 1994 Dæhlie was the best cross-country skier in the world and was expected to win this event, especially since it was in freestyle, his stronger style. He started well and led at all checkpoints as he went through, starting in the 60th spot. But a few starters later, Finland’s Mika Myllylä posted a faster time at the first checkpoint, but he would not be able to maintain that pace, eventually dropping back to third place and the bronze medal. But starting 69th was Dæhlie’s teammate, Thomas Alsgaard, who was only 22-years-old and had little international experience. He was seventh at the 1.7 km time check, but moved ahead at 7.1 km, and led the rest of the way to win a surprising gold medal by over 47 seconds ahead of his legendary teammate. It was the start of a great career for Alsgaard who would ski at the 1998 and 2002 Winter Olympics, winning gold medals in the pursuit and relay in both years.

Hsu was not only the 2012 runner-up (and thus poised to become champion following Chinshanlo’s disqualification), but was also the reigning World champion and the 2014 runner-up. Romania’s Cristina Iovu, the 2012 Olympic bronze medalist and reigning European champion, also found herself entangled in a doping scandal and did not attend the 2016 Games. Other contenders included China’s Li Yajun, the 2013 World Champion and 2014 bronze medalist, and Hidilyn Diaz of the Philippines, the 2015 World bronze medalist. Yuliya Paratova of Ukraine, the 2013 and 2015 European champion and 2014 runner-up, competed in the flyweight division in Rio.
Li bested the Olympic record of her countrywoman Yang Xia, the 2000 Olympic champion, in the snatch with a 101 kg lift, but Hsu was only 1 kg behind. No other competitor lifted more than 90 kg, leaving Li and Hsu the only likely contenders for gold. In the clean and jerk, Li believed she had made a successful 123 kg lift and, far ahead of Hsu’s 112 kg first lift, attempted and failed 126 kg twice. The judges, however, had reversed their decision on Li’s 123 kg lift due to elbow bending and both Li and her coaches claimed not to have known this until after the competition had ended. Thus Hsu, who had failed to lift 126 kg in her second round, declined a third attempt and secured the bronze medal. Diaz also managed to record 112 kg in the clean and jerk, but her much lower snatch posting of 88 kg left her far behind overall in second place. Yoon Jin-Hee of South Korea, the 2008 Olympic runner-up who had returned in 2014 from a three-year retirement, nabbed bronze.

Simply open one of the various books on the Olympics, and many of them will list the gold medalists, many the medalists, and a few give deeper placings.  Rarely is there a problem.  The results of the 1960 Olympic 100 metre freestyle swim are always given as listed below. But there’s often a lot behind those statistics.  In this case, the above result ranks with the 1972 Olympic basketball final and the 1908 400 metre run as one of the most controversial Olympic finishes ever.
In the summer of 1960, the favorite for this event was Jeff Farrell of the United States.  However, six days before the U.S. Olympic Trials, Jeff Farrell had to undergo an emergency appendectomy.  He was barely able to compete at the Trials and bravely held on to finish fourth, but that only earned him a relay spot at the Olympics.  Jon Henricks was the defending champion and was another contender but he also fell prey to illness as intestinal problems hampered him once he got to Rome, and he was eliminated in the semi-finals.
This left the favorite’s role to John Devitt, who, even with Farrell in the race, would have been a strong contender.  Devitt was born in Sydney and began swimming internationally in the early 1950’s.  He competed at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, winning a silver medal in the 100 freestyle behind Jon Henricks and he won a gold member as a member of Australia’s 4 x 200 metre freestyle relay team.  Beginning in January 1957, he set three world records in the 100 metres and 110 yard freestyle.  He won three consecutive Australian titles, replacing Henricks as Australia’s top sprint swimmer (Henricks had won four consecutive Australian titles - 1953-56).  In 1959, John Konrads handed Devitt his first defeat in over two years, but he was thought to be a stronger distance swimmer.  Devitt had also been Commonwealth Games champion at 100 metres in 1958.
Lance Larson was not highly considered for the freestyle prior to the Olympic Trials.  His previous best event had been the butterfly.  He was the first man to break one minute in the 100 metre butterfly which he accomplished in June 1960 with a time of 59.0 seconds.  Larson had attended Southern Cal and was a superb all-around swimmer.  At various times he was an AAU champion in the freestyle, the butterfly, and the individual medley.  He was primarily a sprinter, however, and in 1960 the only butterfly event on the schedule was the 200 metre butterfly.  Larson competed at the Olympic Trials in the 200 butterfly but failed to make the team, finishing fourth.  In the 100 metre freestyle, however, he won the Trials.  Speaking years later, he has admitted that it is unlikely he could have beaten a healthy Jeff Farrell.
At Rome, the heats of the 100 freestyle were uneventful, as Larson, Devitt, Henricks, and Manuel dos Santos (BRA) all won their heats.  The semi-finals were marked only by Jon Henricks failing to qualify, with the three heats being won by Devitt, Dos Santos, and Larson.  Larson had the fastest semi-final time of 55.5, with Devitt posting a 55.8, both far from Devitt’s world record of 54.6.
The finals were held on Friday, 26 August, at 9:10 (2110) at night.  Dos Santos started the fastest and led at 50 metres, with Devitt and Larson equal second at the turn.  Dos Santos faded over the last 50 metres and Devitt came on with a rush.  Larson also closed, but more slowly, catching Devitt again at about 80 metres.  It appeared to most observers that Larson barely out-touched Devitt, although the result was very close.  Before getting out of the pool, Devitt congratulated Lance Larson.
The 1960 Olympics were held in the days prior to automatic starting pistols, automatic touch pads, and electronic timing.  There was an electronic timer at Rome, but it was used as a back-up system only.  Results in 1960 were decided by finish judges who relied on their eyes and did not use replays.  There were three first-place judges and three second-place judges.  Of the three first-place judges, they were split, 2-1, favoring Devitt.  The three second-place judges also favored Devitt for second, by 2-1.  Therefore, the six judges were split, 3-3, in terms of who won.
There were three official timers in 1960 for each lane and swimmer, all timing by hand.  All three timers for Devitt, in lane three, timed him in 55.2 seconds.  The three timers for lane four, had timed Larson in 55.0, 55.1, and 55.1 seconds; thus timing seemed to favor Larson.  The judges then turned to the electronic back-up timer to break the tie.  The electronic timing had Larson in 55.10 seconds and Devitt in 55.16 seconds, a difference of about 4 inches.  Using both the hand times and the electronic times, Larson’s time should have been listed as 55.1 seconds, with Devitt at 55.2.
After a long delay, the chief judge, Henry Runströmer of Sweden cast the deciding vote and declared Devitt the winner.  He ruled that Larson would be given the time of 55.2 seconds.  However, the rules at that time did not provide for the chief judge to have a vote or give him the right to break ties.  Ties were supposed to be broken by referring to the timing machine.  The United States’ team appealed.  The appeal jury, headed by Jan de Vries (NED), also the President of the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA) in 1960, rejected the appeal, keeping Devitt the winner.
Max Ritter was Treasurer of the U.S. Olympic Committee in 1960, and was also a member of the Executive Committee of FINA.  There was also one Australian member on the FINA Executive Committee.  Ritter took the protest at Rome to FINA, again headed by Jan de Vries, and again it was rebuffed by the Executive Committee by a vote of 5-3.  After the Rome Olympics, the protests did not end.  Max Ritter took it as his personal mission to see that Lance Larson received the gold medal Ritter thought he had earned.  Over the next four years, he continued to file official protests, first with the entire membership of FINA, and finally with the International Olympic Committee.  They were all rejected.  The result stood.  Thus John Devitt was declared the champion and received a gold medal at Rome, while Lance Larson received a silver medal.  They were declared co-holders of the Olympic record in 55.2 seconds, a time Larson assuredly had bettered.
Ritter mainly blamed Bertil Sällfors of Sweden for the result, who was the secretary-general of FINA in 1960.  In an article in Amateur Athlete, Ritter wrote, “This whole sorry mess can be attributed to the incompetence of the then secretary of FINA, Bertil Sällfors of Sweden.  As a FINA secretary of long-standing, he should have known that in the FINA swimming competitions, such as the Olympic Games, no vote is ever bestowed upon the chief judge (when there is controversy).  Sällfors argued that in Sweden, they give the chief judge a vote; however, Olympic Games in Rome are different from competitions in Sweden.  If Sällfors would have followed regular FINA procedure and would not have given the chief judge a vote, we could have registered a clear-cut result, such as always is the endeavour in international competition.”
In some of his writings about the protest, Ritter noted, “When I questioned the chief judge how he came to vote for Devitt as the winner, he stated that he stood at the finish line and saw clearly that Devitt outtouched Larson at the finish.”  However, a photograph of the finish in Sports Illustrated incriminates Runströmer’s ability to accurately judge the finish.  First of all, he was opposite lane 8, five and six lanes from Devitt and Larson.  Secondly, he is five yards away from the finish line, so he was not looking down at the touch pads directly, but only at an angle from 25 yards away.
Relay races at Rome helped bring some justice to the story.  Lance Larson did not swim on the 4 x 200 metre freestyle relay team for the U.S., which won a gold medal, but he swam the butterfly leg for the medley relay, thus earning his gold medal in that event.  Devitt did swim in the 4 x 200 relay, helping Australia to a bronze medal.
John Devitt was a great swimmer whose career has been somewhat tainted by all the controversy surrounding his Olympic victory.  His Olympic record includes two gold, one silver, and one bronze medal.  He won three gold medals at the 1958 Commonwealth Games, broke 14 world records (4 individual, 10 team), and won 13 Australian championships (3 individual and 10 team).  Devitt thinks he won the race.  He feels that the timekeepers had a poor view of the finish and missed his underwater touch.  “I started to take another stroke with my left hand, but I was so close to the wall that I reached out more with my right while it was under water and I think it was not seen,” Devitt stated in later years.  He retired from swimming after the Rome Olympics.
Lance Larson attended dental school after the Olympics, and also retired from international competition.  But in the mid-1970’s he began swimming competitively again in Masters’ competition and has become a multiple record setter and champion in that field.  He has become rather philosophical about the controversy.  “We all compete, to some degree, looking for recognition and a measure of fame.  The one good thing about the decision is that it has kept my name in the public eye longer than it would have if I had been declared the champion,”  Larson commented.  He also feels he won the race.  “I think John has had to live with the feeling for many years that he probably didn’t really win that gold medal.”  Larson and Devitt met again for the first time more than 20 years after the race and got on very well, by Larson’s reports.
The result of the controversy was that FINA decided that electronic timing was a necessity to avoid such problems in the future.  Since the 1968 Olympics, all international swim races have been timed electronically.  But the result still reads: Rome - 1960 - 100 metre freestyle: 1. Devitt 55.2, 2. Larson 55.2.  There’s often a lot behind those lines.

Ender finished the 100 fly at 1948, and a few minutes later stood on the medal podium. Twenty minutes after this race ended she came back to the pool deck for the final of the 200 freestyle. A few minutes after that, she had won her second individual gold medal within 27 minutes. Ender would finish the Montréal Olympics with four gold medals, adding gold in the 100 freestyle and medley relay, and a silver in the 4×100 freestyle relay.

The event was completely open as most of the recent podium finishers at the Worlds were not present in Moskva. In the semi-finals Robert Dill-Bundi of Switzerland defeated Denmark’s Hans-Henrik Ørsted in a world record time of 4:32.29. Dill-Bundi then defeated France’s Alain Bondue in the final to win the gold medal. Ørsted won the bronze medal race. All three medalists turned professional before the end of the year. Ørsted placed third in the pursuit at the World Pro Championships later in 1980. Bondue was World Champion in 1981 and 1982, while Dill-Bundi placed second in the pro pursuit worlds in 1983. But it was Ørsted who had the best record as a pro. He won the World Championship in 1984, 1985, and 1987, and was on the podium in the event every year from 1980-1987.
The medal ceremony was a very unusual sight. Dill-Bundi, Bondue and Ørsted were all from nations that were protesting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, not by boycotting, but by refusing to have their national flags at the 1980 Olympics. Thus all 3 nations were represented by the Olympic Flag, and 3 Olympic Flags were raised on the 3 flagpoles to represent the 3 medalists.

Bobick had won the Pan American Games gold medal in 1971 scoring a victory over young Cuban Teófilo Stevenson on his way to the title. Since then he had remained unbeaten and had scored a series of impressive victories including three victories on a US tour of the Soviet Union. Bobick and Stevenson scored comfortable victories in their first round bouts but were then drawn to face each other in the quarter-finals. From the start Stevenson used his jab to open the American’s defences and skewered him with a succession of hooks and uppercuts. Despite sporting an ugly swelling under his eye, Bobick briefly fought back in the second round but it was not enough and by the middle of round three his resistance had faded. The Cuban landed a right hand punch that sent Bobick crumpling to the canvas and, although he got back to his feet, the fight was stopped shortly afterwards. Stevenson followed this victory with another stoppage, this time over West Germany’s Peter Hussing in the semi-finals and then claimed the Olympic title by walkover when Ion Alexe was ruled out of the final with a broken thumb. The Cuban’s performance earned him the Val Barker Trophy as the best boxer of the Games and a reputation as the “new Muhammad Ali“. True to his communist beliefs he refused offers to defect and start a professional career and instead became one of the legendary figures of amateur boxing. He won three Olympic and three World amateur titles during his career.

The big Norwegian star Thorleif Haug had won the classical Holmenkollen 50 km (the only cross country event in Holmenkollen until 1933, when the 18 km was included in the program) five times between 1918 and 1923, but in 1922 the Norwegians were shocked by a Finnish double, when Anton Collin and Tapani Niku outclassed the Norwegians and Haug had to be content with a modest 9th place. It was the first time that a non-Norwegian was able to win in Holmenkollen. Besides Collin and Niku, the Norwegians also feared their Swedish neighbours. The small and quiet Torkel Persson, a native Sami from Jämtland, was considered as the strongest in the team together with Per-Erik Hedlund from Särna, the starting point of another Nordic classical competition, Vasaloppet.
The 33 competitors were met with cold and windy conditions when the first starter, the Frenchman André Blusset was sent away at 8:37 AM. The skiers started with intervals of one minute in a one-lap course with a really demanding height difference of 820 meters. First of the favorites was Collin with number 3, chased by the Norwegian Johan Grøttumsbraaten 1 minute behind. The big favorite Haug started as number 23, chasing Niku 2 minutes ahead of him.
Already in the early stages of the race, it was clear that this would be a great day for the Norwegians. Collin broke one of his skies and had to give up. Grøttumsbraaten had a 1.30 lead over Haug after  20 km, followed by Matti Raivio, Hedlund, Niku and the two other Norwegians, Jon Mårdalen and Thoralf Strømstad. 10 km later all four Norwegians were in front. Haug had overtaken Grøttumsbraaten by one minute, with Strømstad 7 and Mårdalen 8 minutes behind. Niku and Hedlund were fading, 15 and 16 minutes behind Haug, and both gave up shortly after. Strømstad was fastest in the last stage of the race and passed Grøttumsbraaten, but Haug kept his lead to the finish, and his victory margin to Strømstad was a clear 1.51. Mårdalen finished his last 20 km 6 minutes faster than Grøttumsbraaten, but had to be content with 4th place. Persson in 5th place was 16 minutes behind Mårdalen, and all 8 skiers from the Nordic countries that finished the race took the 8th first places. The Italians were the best of the Middle Europeans, placing 9-10-11-13.
The Norwegian journalist Finn Amundsen, later a famous sports commentator for Norwegain radio, wired an enthusiastic report home to his paper Idrætsliv under the heading “Vi viste verden vinterveien!” (We showed the world the winter way!), later to become a famous slogan for Norwegian winter sports.

Koss was the defending champion, and he had won the pre-Olympic World Cup on the Hamar rink back in December. But he faced stiff competition from both his own country and the Netherlands. Koss’ team mate Ådne Søndrål, had won two World Cup races earlier in the season, and had finished second behind Koss in the Albertville Games. Of the Dutch skaters, Falko Zandstra and Rintje Ritsma had the best chances. Zandstra had won the Davos World Cup, while Ritsma had won the distance at the European Championships in January in Hamar. Ritsma had then bettered the world record - which still dated from the 1988 Olympics - to 1:51.60.
Koss was the first of these favorites to race. Skating a final lap that was unheard of (29.38), he managed to beat Ritsma’s world best mark by 0.31 seconds, setting it at 1:51.29. Next up was Søndrål. While a sprinter, he couldn’t match Koss’s splits early on, and never came close to his compatriot’s time, despite setting a personal best of 1:53.13. In the next pair, it was Zandstra. At the bell, the Dutch World Allround Champion was about equal with Koss, but his final lap was over a second slower than the Norwegian’s. Ritsma, going in pair six, met with the same fate. Leading by two tenths at 1,100 m, he lost a lot in the last 400 m, ending up with 1:51.99, slightly outside his own former world record. At the victory press conference, Johann Olav Koss announced he would donate his victory reward to the victims of the war in Bosnia, and especially Sarajevo, the host of the 1984 Winter Olympics that had been ravaged by war.

Another prominent ski jumper was the young Japanese woman Sara Takanashi, born in 1996, who had been competing internationally since the age of 12. She won the overall World Cup four times, in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017. In the Olympic season, Norwegian Maren Lundby emerged as a clear favorite, winning 7 out of 10 World Cup competitions in the weeks before the Games. In the Olympic competition, Lundby took a 2.2 points lead in the first round over the German Katharina Althaus, with Takanashi in 3rd position and Althaus having the longest jump of the round, 106.5 m. In the final round, Lundby – in spite of reduced speed – made the longest jump of the day (110.0 m) and took the gold by a comfortable margin. Althaus secured the silver medal with a new good jump, with Takanashi holding third place. Defending champion Vogt ended up a distant fifth. Lundby ended her excellent season by winning the total World Cup by a large margin, winning 9 out of 15 competitions and never placing lower than third. Lundby made ski jumping history when, at age 14, she was selected for the first female ski jumping championships in Liberec 2009, starting as number one in the competition. She ended the competition placing 22 out of 36 competitors.

Women had contested the match sprint at the World Championships since 1958, and a number of outstanding women cyclists never had the opportunity to compete at the Olympics. Notable among these were Galina Yermolayeva (URS), six-time World Champion, who won 14 medals in the event between 1958-73; American Sheila Young, Olympic speed skating champion who was World Champion in 1973, 1976, and 1981; and Soviet Galina Tsareva, World Champion from 1977-79.
Coming into Seoul, the three dominant female sprinters of the 80s had been American Connie Paraskevin-Young, sister-in-law of Sheila Young and World Champion in 1982-84, and again in 1990; Soviet/Estonian sprinter Erika Salumäe, World Champion in 1987 and again in 1989; and Christa Luding-Rothenburger, East German World Champion in 1986 and runner-up to Salumae in 1987. Both Paraskevin-Young and Luding-Rothenburger had competed at the Olympics in speed skating – Paraskevin-Young in 1984, while Luding-Rothenburger had competed in speed skating in both 1984 and 1988, and won a gold medal in the 1,000 metres in 1988. In the end, the three favorites would win the medals. In the first semi, Salumäe defeated Paraskevin-Young in two straight races. Luding-Rothenburger had more trouble in her semi, needing three races to get past France’s Isabelle Gautheron. With that victory, Luding-Rothenburger made Olympic history, guaranteeing she would become the first woman to win medals in both the Winter and Summer Olympics. The final went to Salumäe in three races, after Luding-Rothenburger had won the first race. Salumäe would return in 1992 to defend her title, then representing Estonia, a historic victory for her renascent nation.

Prior to the Olympics, major discussion ensued when several European clubs would not release their players to compete in the Olympics. After a short summer holiday because of the European Championships, several teams had to compete in the preliminary rounds of the Champions League or UEFA Cup, and required their players to be present. The clubs argued the Olympic tournament was not on the official international calendar, and thus they were not required to release their players, as is common for international tournaments. The International Football Federation (FIFA) meanwhile announced that the tournament had been “informally” on the calendar for years, and clubs would have to oblige. Eventually, the case was taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which decided in favour of the clubs. Eventually, most players did play in Beijing, although a few were forced to fly back to Europe before completion of the competition.
Two of the affected footballers were the star players of the South American favourites, Lionel Messi (Argentina) and Ronaldinho (Brazil). Both played for Spanish side FC Barcelona, which wanted the players to withdraw. However, Messi was eventually allowed to compete, while Ronaldinho completed a transfer to Italy just before the Olympics. Ronaldinho’s Brazil was looking to finally win the Olympic gold medal that had eluded Brazil for decades, while Argentina was defending its 2004 title, and had won the 2005 and 2007 editions of the U20 World Cup. Other contenders were assumed to be the African sides of Cameroon (the 2000 Champions), Nigeria (gold in 1996) and Italy and the Netherlands from Europe.
Brazil and Argentina were the only teams to qualify for the quarter-finals undefeated. Both needed extra time to win their matches against Cameroon and the Netherlands, respectively, before clashing in the semi-finals. The match was highly anticipated, but turned out to be a fairly one-sided affair, with Argentina beating their neighbours 3-0. Two goals were scored by Sergio Agüero, with his father-in-law (former star player Maradona) watching from the stands. In the other semi-final, Nigeria had little trouble with Belgium, the tournament’s biggest surprise.
In the final, a replay of the 1996 Olympic final in Atlanta, Nigeria and Argentina were evenly matched in the first 45 minutes. In the 58th minute, a quick break from Argentina resulted in the match’s only goal, as Ángel di Maria chipped the ball over the goalkeeper. Nigeria pressed hard in the final half hour, but were unable to pull of the same stunt as in 1996. Argentina thus became the first repeat winners of the Olympic title in 40 years, after Hungary won the title in 1964 and 1968.

The silver medal was decided on a desperately close decision in favour of Sweden who tied 8-8 against France but were awarded victory on the basis of more hits, 32-31.

It was not the first race at this Games, as the first run of the women’s giant slalom had already been held, but the men’s downhill was held before the second run.
The downhill piste, named “Rock”, was again created by Bernhard Russi, this time assisted by Didier Défago, and Russi called the slope comparable to the Birds of Prey in Beaver Creek. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no races on the piste before Beijing, as the World Cup events planned for February 2020 had to be cancelled. Therefore, the slope was brand new for all racers and only two training runs could be held as the third one was cancelled due to strong winds.
The downhill World Cup since the last Olympics in South Korea had been dominated by Beat Feuz, who had won all four downhill Crystal Globes since then (2018-2021). The last two World champions, however, were Kjetil Jansrud (2019 in Åre) and Vincent Kriechmayr (2021 in Cortina d’Ampezzo).
The ongoing World Cup of the current season saw eight downhills held with six different winners and only Aleksander Aamodt Kilde was able to win more than one race with wins in Beaver Creek, Wengen 1, and Kitzbühel 1. The other races were won by Matthias Mayer (Lake Louise), Bryce Bennett (Val Gardena), Dominik Paris (Bormio), Vincent Kriechmayr (Wengen 2), and Beat Feuz (Kitzbühel 2). The results put Kilde at the top of the standings, followed by Feuz, Mayer, and Odermatt (who finished second in three races).
Of the medallists from PyeongChang, the Norwegians Aksel Lund Svindal (gold) had retired in February 2019 and Kjetil Jansrud (silver) did not start after still recovering from an injury following a fall in early December 2021. This led to only Feuz (bronze) participating in the Beijing race. The first training run was won by Stefan Rogentin, but Kilde set the best time by winning the second training run with 1:43.72.
The race started with only 42 competitors, the fewest ever for this event, and was held in good conditions with the wind not being a factor on race day. Kriechmayr with bib number 1 set the early pace but was overtaken by his compatriot Mayer, with Kilde placing between them and the surprising Jack Crawford, only seven-hundredths of a second behind Mayer. Feuz started with bib number 13 and put in a great performance, and took the lead by 16/100ths. Paris and Odermatt were not able to get into a podium position and the last racer of the top group was French veteran Johan Clarey. He finished second, just 1/10th behind Feuz, knocking Crawford off the podium, who finally finished fourth.
Feuz won the race with an average speed of 110.50 km/h and 3.07 metres ahead of Clarey. The first four finishers all used Head skis while Kilde in fifth place raced Atomic. Clarey, already the second oldest male Olympic Alpine skier to participate in Beijing, became the oldest Alpine skiing medallist ever at 41-030. Boštjan Kline, who finished 10th, achieved the best ever result for a male Slovenian downhiller and Adur Etxezarreta archived the same for Spain with his 17th place.

In truth the contest for gold was hardly a contest at all as the Chinese duo took the lead on their dive and added a few more points to it on every successive dive. This was He’s first Olympic title but the third for Wu who had also won the event in 2004 and 2008.

Phelps and Lochte came into Rio with the 16 fastest performances of all-time. The other main medal contender was Japan’s Kosuke Hagino, but he was expected to trail the Americans.
Lochte led the final at 100 metres, but faded badly and finished fifth. Phelps moved into the lead at 150 metres and looked like his 2008 self coming home, winning by almost two seconds over Hagino. Bronze went to China’s Wang Shun.
Phelps’s win gave him four consecutive individual gold medals in the event, matching the feats of Al Oerter in athletics discus throw from 1956-60, Carl Lewis in athletics long jump from 1984-96, and Ben Ainslie in single-handed sailing from 2000-12. If you count the 1906 Olympics, one can also include Ray Ewry, who won standing high jump and standing long jump gold medals from 1900-08. Phelps gold was also his 13th Olympic gold medal in an individual event, breaking the tie in that category that he held with Leonidas of Rhodes.

He had won gold at Antwerp in Greco-Roman middleweight, had already won the light-heavyweight Greco title in Paris, and in 1932 won the unlimited Greco-Roman class to become one of the few Olympic wrestlers with three gold medals. But this was a rare freestyle appearance for him and he lost in the semi-finals to little-known American John Spellman. Spellman then defeated Sweden’s Rudolf Svensson for the gold medal. Spellman later became a professional wrestler and football player, playing in the NFL for eight seasons with the Providence Steamrollers and Boston Redskins.
Svensson also competed in Greco-Roman in Paris, losing the final in this weight class to Westergren. In the freestyle second-place Bergvall tournament, Svensson turned the tables on Westergren in the first round, and then defeated Britain’s Walter Wilson for the silver, giving him two wrestling silver medals in Paris. Switzerland’s Charles Courant, the silver medalist in this event in 1920, had lost to Svensson in the semi-finals of the main tournament and had two walkovers in the third-place tournament to win bronze.

Since 2014, however, they had won three golds, two silvers and a bronze in the three World Championships, including a clean sweep in 2017 when Francesco Friedrich and Johannes Lochner shared the gold medal. Furthermore, they ended the 2017-18 World Cup season occupying the first three places with Lochner piloting the winning team, as the Germans came to the PyeongChang also occupying the top three world ranking places, with Lochner 1st, Friedrich 2nd, and Nico Walther 3rd.
Lochner, a nephew of the 1972 2-man silver medalist Rudi Lochner, won four of the seasons’ eight World Cup races, while runner-up Friedrich failed to register a win but, thanks to a consistent season-long campaign, was runner-up. Germany took the bronze medal after Walther and his crew won the final race of the season to snatch overall third place from Canada’s Justin Kripps by a single point.
The Latvian four of Oskars Melbardis, Daumants Dreiskens, Arvis Vilkaste and Janis Strenga were the surprise winners at Sochi in 2014, and defended their title in PyeongChang. Since their Olympic triumph, they had finished third at the 2015 World Championships, and won their first World title the following year. They came to the Games having finished fifth in the 2017-18 World Cup.
Friedrich was the joint gold medal winner in the 2-man bob event at PyeongChang and, following the German women’s success, was keen to make it three golds out of three for Germany at these Games. All three of their sleds set good times in official 4-man training, as did the local hero Won Yun-Jong. The fastest time in official training, however, was 49.07 by Benjamin Maier of Austria. That time was bettered on the very first run of heat one, however, as Won, despite being world ranked number 49, set the pace with a new track record 48.65.
The three Germans all followed each other in the first heat starting order. First to go was Johannes Lochner, and he moved into second place 0.3 seconds behind Won. Next to go was Friedrich, and he established yet another new track record 48.54 to take the lead. Walther slotted into third place with a 49.74 run, with Melbardis fourth and Canada’s Justin Kripps fifth, despite setting a new start record.
The two Germans, Friedrich and Walther, had the fastest two runs of heat two, with the former’s 49.01 being 0.15 faster than his compatriot. Switzerland’s Rico Peter also registered the same time as Walther, 49.16, but ended the day lying in joint fifth place. Won held on to second place overall after a 49.19, and Walther held on to third. Despite setting a start record 4.82 in heat one, and being joint fastest starter in heat two, Canada’s Justin Kripps let a great chance to move into a medal place slip away.
At the half-way stage, however, Kripps, the other 2-man joint gold medalist, was fourth, with three men, Lochner, Melbardis and Rico Peter, sharing fifth, 0.66 seconds behind the leader Friedrich, who was on track to make it two golds for him personally at the Games, and three for Germany. Friedrich was first to go in heat three and put in another great performance with the fastest run of the heat, 48.76 as he increased his lead over Won to 0.42s with Walter a further 7/100ths behind in third. Peter and Kripps shared fourth place but nearly 8/10ths behind the leader.
The track was running at its slowest in the fourth and final heat, with the ice temperature at -5.8C, the warmest of the event, as the field was cut from 29 to 20. Rico Peter registered the fastest run of the heat, but none of the contenders could match the consistency of Friedrich, whose 49.54 took the gold medal 0.53s ahead of Won Yun-Jong and Nico Walther, who shared the silver medal in the second tie for a bobsleigh medal of the Games. For Switzerland’s Peter, he had the consolation of finishing fourth but, sadly, it still maintained Switzerland’s 4-man medal drought going back to 2006. Despite setting a start record for the second time, Justin Kripps could only finish sixth overall in what was a disappointing event for him.
For Friedrich, and team-mates Candy Bauer, Martin Grothkopp and Thorsten Margis, they had the honour of leading Germany to the third and final bobsleigh gold of the Games, the first time since 2006 that one country had won all three golds at the same Games. Friedrich and Margis also became the first men since André Lange and Kevin Kuske at Turin 2006, to win the 2- and 4-man golds at the same Games, while Won Yun-Jong had the honour of piloting the first Asian crew to an Olympic bob medal. Pride and place, however, was reserved for Kevin Kuske, a member of the German silver-medal winning team, who became the most decorated Olympic bobsleigher of all time, with his sixth medal (four golds and two silvers), stretching back to 2002.

Australia rallied on the penultimate leg but Gary Hall, Jr.  earned redemption for his 4 x 100 metres freestyle swim by extending the gap on the final leg.

Out of 32 entrants, 20 used the butterfly stroke including twelve of the sixteen semi-finalists.

He was helped by his hydration plan. Though the US was in the midst of prohibition and alcoholic beverages were outlawed, Noël convinced US officials that wine was an essential part of his diet.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"The tournament for the men’s middleweight  Greco-Roman wrestling crown seemed as if it would shape up to be a battle between World Champions Selçuk Çebi of Turkey and Roman Vlasov of Russia. Çebi had been World Champion in 2009 and 2010, but was unseated in 2011 by Vlasov, who had just made the jump from the junior to the senior edition of the competition. While these two were the favorites for gold, attention was also given to Arsen Julfalakyan of Armenia who was vying to repeat the feat of his father Levon, who won a gold medal in the lightweight Greco-Roman category in 1988. Arsen had been eliminated in the 1/8 finals of the 2008 Summer Games, but had improved significantly since then with second and third-place finishes at the 2010 and 2011 World Championships respectively. If he won the gold medal in London, he would become part of the first father-son Olympic wrestling champions. The other 2011 World Championship bronze medalist, Neven Žugaj, was aiming to become the first Croatian Olympic wrestling medalist, while Christophe Guénot was the only returning Olympic medalist from the 2008 Games.
In a shocking turn of events, Çebi was eliminated in his opening match by Robert Rosengren, an unheralded wrestler from Sweden. The only question now was who would face Vlasov in the final, a call answered by Julfalakyan who, unlike Vlasov, never lost a round on his journey to the gold medal match. In the end, however, Vlasov demonstrated clear superiority over Julfalakyan, successfully defending against his opponent’s aggressive style and bringing each round to par terre, where his strength gave him the advantage in both the top and bottom positions. Vlasov successfully flipped, then defended, in this stage, winning the match in two rounds and claiming the top podium spot.
The first bronze medal match pitted Aleksandras Kazakevičius of Lithuania against Mark O. Madsen of Denmark, both veteran Olympians from 2008. Madsen was a three-time silver medalist at the World Championships (2005, 2007, and 2009) while Kazakevičius was fighting at a disadvantage, having injured his right eye in an earlier bout. Nonetheless the Lithuanian maintained his defenses throughout, bringing his opponent to par terre both times, and was able to successfully defend, and then convert, to win the match in two rounds and capture the bronze medal. In the second match, Aleksandr Kikinyov of Belarus, who had competed in the 2004 Summer Games and had a bronze medal from the 2009 World Championships, faced Emin Əhmədov of Azerbaijan, a rookie on the international scene. Each wrestler was able to convert their par terre top advantage to a point in the first two rounds, leading to a third round where, with points and cautions tied, a ball was drawn and Əhmədov was given the opportunity to choose his position in the third par terre. Selecting the top, the Azerbaijani was able to drive Kikinyov out of the ring for a point, although this ruling was unclear and challenged at first. Even when replays showed clearly that the Belarusian had stepped outside, however, Kikinyov refused to admit defeat or shake hands with his opponent. Regardless of these protestations, Əhmədov was awarded the bronze medal.

The format of this event had also changed since the last Olympics. The qualification round was contested over 60 shots to equal the men’s competition, and the final round was held over 24 shots like all other pistol and rifle finals at these Games. There were 53 shooters in this event, which was the highest number of starters in the history of this event and also the highest number of starters in any individual shooting competition at Tokyo.
The field included the reigning 2018 World Champion Anna Korakaki, who was the world record holder for qualification rounds and bronze medallist from Rio 2016. Also competing was the 2018 World Championships runner-up, world record holder for final rounds Zorana Arunović. The gold medallist from Rio, however, Zhang Mengxue, was not present in Tokyo. The world ranking leaders from just before the Games were present with Yashaswini Singh Deswal (ranked first), Manu Bhaker (second), gold medallist at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in this event, and Viktoryia Chaika (third). Chaika competed in her six Olympics, but this made her only the fourth most experienced shooter in this event as Mariya Grozdeva and Otryadyn Gündegmaa each participated in their seventh Games, and Nino Salukvadze was competing in her ninth Olympics. With this appearance, Salukvadze became the first woman to compete in nine Olympics and she also equalled the participation record for shooters held by Afanasijs Kuzmins.
Of all the above, only Korakaki qualified for the final. She finished second to Jiang Ranxin, who equaled Korakaki’s qualification world record with 587 points. In the final Korakaki was eliminated after 16 shots to finish sixth. Jiang was eliminated after 22 shots to win bronze. This left Antoaneta Kostadinova and Vitalina Batsarashkina to battle for gold. Kostadinova had been in the lead since the 12th shot and was still in the lead by 0.5 points going into the last shot, but with only a 9.0 from her final shot, her weakest shot of the final, she was overtaken by Batsarashkina who scored a 10.4 to win gold, to go one better than the silver won in Rio. Batsarashkina’s gold was also the first gold medal for the team Russian Olympic Committee and it ended a series of three consecutive wins by China in this event.
Anna Dulce of Moldova, who finished 48th, was born on 22 October 2005 and she became the youngest ever female shooting competitor at the Olympics, aged 15 years 276 days.

The United States also had one World Championship bronze medal (1979), while Romania had three (1974, 1975, and 1981). Only a final was held for this event in Los Angeles and it was the Americans who came in with an Olympic-best time under three minutes to win the gold medal.

As expected the American proceeded to blitz the field and won by the almost unbelievable margin of nearly two and a half seconds. Peirsol was celebrating his victory when suddenly the scoreboard flickered and the letters DQ appeared next to his name to indicate he was disqualified from the final. His offence was to kick into the final turn after he’d turned onto his stomach to make the turn, which is illegal under the rules. For half an hour it appeared that Markus Rogan had become the first Austrian Olympic swimming champion since the inaugural Summer Olympics in 1896 but his joy was short-lived. FINA announced that the disqualification could not stand because the official judging the turns had made an error in the paperwork and had failed to describe the nature of the infringement in either French or English on the relevant document. This was a serious breach of the regulations. Appeals from both Austria and Great Britain were rejected.
Piersol returned for a third Olympic Games in 2008 but was narrowly beaten by his fellow American Ryan Lochte. His 2008 silver added to that won in 2000 meant that he became one of the rare few swimmers to have medalled in the same event at three successive Games.

Gong had won silver at London in 2012 and bronze in Beijing in 2008, but sadly, neither came at the Games themselves as she was advanced to those medals later after doping disqualifications.
American Raven Saunders was the first thrower in the final and her 19.65 would have been good for the silver medal, although she improved it in round five with 19.79. Four throwers later, Gong recorded 19.95, which settled the competition for gold, although she would have three better marks – with 19.98 in round three, 20.53 in round five, and 20.58 in round six.
Adams rounded out the podium, throwing 19.62 in round three, giving her a fourth Olympic medal and a full set with two golds, a silver, and a bronze. Gong’s gold also completed her set of Olympic medals. Saunders stood out during the competition, competing in a mask in both qualifying and final, with her hair dyed green on the left side and purple on the right.

He was the 1989 and 1991 World Champion, had won five consecutive titles at the Kodokan Cup, and six consecutive victories at the All-Japan Championships. Veteran Hungarian judoka Bertalan Hajtós was considered the top European, having medaled at the European Championships back in 1985, and winning in 1986, but he had not yet made the podium at the World Championships. In the early rounds, he was the most impressive fighter, winning four straight matches by ippon. Koga struggled to make the final after injuring his knee in a sparring session before the Olympics. The final came down to hantei, with Koga winning by yusei-gachi, which surprised many in the crowd who thought Hajtós had won. Koga would retire after Barcelona, but returned in 1995 to win the Worlds in half-middleweight and also won a silver at the 1996 Olympics in half-middleweight.
The day before this event, Israel’s Yael Arad became the first Israeli athlete to win an Olympic medal, when she placed second in the women’s half-middleweight division. Arad dedicated her medal to “the eleven” – the 11 Israelis who had been cowardly murdered by Black September terrorists at the 1972 Olympics. In this class, Israel’s Shay-Oren Smadga won a bronze medal, the first Olympic medal won by an Israeli man.

Defending champion Roberto Cammarelle was joined in London by world champion Məhəmmədrəsul Məcidov of Azerbaijan, Beijing finalist Zhang Zhilei of China and the rising young British talent Anthony Joshua.
Though cheered on fanatically by the home support Joshua was nearly eliminated in his first fight and was fortunate to be given the decision over Cuban Erislandy Savón, nephew of the legendary Félix Savón. Joshua improved on this display in his next fights and reached the final with a victory over Russia’s Ivan Dychko while in the other semi-final Cammarelle won a close but deserved decision over Məcidov. The final bout between the Italian and the Briton, whilst not a classic, turned into a nail-biter. For the first two rounds the more streetwise and experienced Cammarelle kept the young British fighter at bay but a desperate attack in the third brought Joshua back into contention. Neutral observers were a little surprised when the score was announced as a tie and the Italian contingent were certainly unhappy when Joshua was awarded the fight on countback.
Joshua’s victory denied Cammarelle the honour of becoming the first man to defend an Olympic title in the heaviest weight category since Teófilo Stevenson.

The new regulations concerning weighing-in caused more difficulties in the flyweight division than in any other. A number of fancied competitors were forced to move up a weight class in order to avoid the possibility of disqualification. This made the prediction of medal hopefuls very difficult although Laurie of the USA, the Frenchman Fayaud, Nunag of the Philippines and the Argentine Carlomagno were touted by some as possible champions.
The 18-year old American Lou Laurie, the youngest member of the US team in Berlin, caught the eye in his first round points victory over Bezděk of Czechoslovakia with his speed and accuracy. After a bye in the opening round, the German fighter Willi Kaiser was also impressive as he forced the referee to stop his second round bout against the Chilean López to save the South American from unnecessary punishment. Kaiser continued his progress with a win over the Uruguayan Fidel Tricánico in the last eight; Tricánico had been fortunate enough to gain a bye in the first round then saw his prospective second round opponent from Peru withdraw in protest at the treatment of the Peruvian football team. The semi-final stage saw Laurie defeated by the strong Sardinian Gavino Matta in a close fight whilst Kaiser turned back the challenge of Carlomagno of Argentina. Laurie won the bronze medal when Carlomagno withdrew and his boxing skills were recognized by the award of the inaugural Val Barker Trophy, presented to the most stylish boxer in the tournament.
In the final Kaiser went on the attack from the outset, forcing the tempo at close quarters and keeping his opponent at bay. When Matta tried to fight back Kaiser pushed the pace even higher and left the Italian with cuts around both eyes. As he tried to turn the fight around Matta became desperate and was warned for fouling his opponent. Towards the end of the fight the Italian tired and Kaiser wrapped up a points decision and Germany’s first ever boxing gold.
The two men met again a year later in the European championship with the same result, although this time it was for the bronze medal rather than gold. Matta and Laurie later turned professional, the Italian winning his national title.

He had bettered the World Record in January (8:17.2), and had convincingly won the 5000 m at the recent World Championships. However, there were a few dangerous competitors. Austria’s Max Stiepl had beaten Ballangrud at the European Championships, clocking an impressive 8:20.7 along the way. Much was also expect of the US’s Eddie Schroeder, Finland’s Birger Wasenius. In his own team, Ballangrud could expect competition from Charles Mathiesen, with a season best of 8:20,2.
The early lead was taken by Antero Ojala, a 19-year-old unknown from Finland. Skating in good ice and weather conditions, none of the skaters could come close to his time, until Ballangrud took the ice. The Norwegian laid down a very “flat” race, and had the advantage of being able to skate towards his pairmate, Aleksander Mitt, who was nearly a lap behind at the finish. Ballangrud’s finishing time was just 2 seconds above the World Record. Three races later, the runner-up of the World Championships, Wasenius, took the ice against Jan Langedijk, of the Netherlands. They would be the fastest pair of the race. Birger Wasenius kept close to Ballangrud’s split times, but lost several seconds in the final laps, while Langedijk came equally close to Ojala’s third place time, but ended up in fourth.

Other medal contenders were Vulha Khudzena of Belarus, world champion in 2017 and silver medallist in 2019, and Emma Jørgensen of Denmark, the Rio silver medallist.
In the semi-finals, both Carrington and Kozák easily won their heats. Jørgensen qualified second behind Linnea Stensils of Sweden, and Tamara Csipes of Hungary won the fourth heat.
The much-anticipated showdown in the final between Carrington and Kozák was over by the halfway stage, with the New Zealander charging out to a big lead with Kozák stuck in a chasing pack. However, it was the other Hungarian, Csipes, who tried valiantly to drag Carrington back to the field and she eventually finished second. Jørgensen picked up the bronze medal and Kozák finished fourth. Carrington added the women’s K-1 500 gold medal to the K-1 200 and the K-2 500 she won two days before, to give her a grand total of six Olympic medals and making her the most successful New Zealand Olympic athlete of all time.
With her three gold medals in Tokyo, she joined the small group of sprint canoeists who had won three gold medals at a single Olympics. She was in the company of the Soviet Vladimir Parfenovich, her compatriot Ian Ferguson, and Kozák.

At Rio, it consisted of six endurance events over two days, now it was just four events over one gruelling day. Laura Kenny was aiming to win her third consecutive Olympic omnium in the last track event of the 2020 Games. She was also hoping to add to her total of five gold medals, and was inspired after seeing husband Jason win his seventh gold a short while earlier.
Standing in Kenny’s way were some extremely good cyclists in this four-discipline event. Kirsten Wild was seen as the biggest threat to Kenny’s domination. The Dutch rider was the 2019 omnium world champion, as well as winning the madison world title that year, and again in 2020. The 2019 and 2020 World Championships silver medallist Letizia Paternoster of Italy was another rider in with a chance, as was Jennifer Valente, a member of the USA pursuit team that won Olympic bronze just a few days earlier. The home crowd had their own favourite in the reigning world champion Yumi Kajihara.
Kenny’s chance of retaining her title was severely disrupted when she was sent hurtling to the track in a multi-rider pile up on the penultimate lap of the opening scratch race. She did not finish the race and was one of nine riders each awarded 16 points, but America’s Valente got the maximum 40 points with Kajihara taking second on 38, and Wild finishing third for 36 points. Kenny came back to take maximum points in the new tempo race but still trailed Valente by 20 points. France’s Clara Copponi took maximum points from the elimination race while Kenny only scored 13 in what was regarded as her best element. Going into the final race, the points race, Valente led by just two points from Kajihara with Norway’s Anita Stenberg a further 14 points behind.
Despite being the top scorer in the points race with 24, it was too much ground for Laura Kenny to make up and she finished sixth. Valente survived a crash in the latter part of the points race, but her 14 points in the last race gave her a total of 124, which was good enough to take gold. Kajihara could not capitalise and scored just two points to finish four points behind Valente. Kirsten Wild scored well and got to within two points of the local favourite to take the bronze medal.
Jennifer Valente won a third consecutive omnium medal for the USA, but it was their first gold after Sarah Hammer’s bronzes in 2012 and 2016. It was also America’s first track cycling gold of the Tokyo Games and their first Olympic gold on the track since Marty Nothstein won the individual sprint at Sydney in 2000.

England had been the victors at the most recent British Empire and Commonwealth Games and, although Great Britain sent a different squad to the 1964 Summer Games, they were considered a medal contender in the coxless fours.
Germany had the most impressive run in the opening round, while Great Britain and Denmark won the other heats. Denmark was represented by the most recent European silver medalists: John Ørsted Hansen, Erik Petersen, Kurt Helmudt, and Bjørn Borgen Hasløv. The Americans advanced to the finals through the repêchage, but did not look strong compared to the other heat winners, Italy and the Netherlands. Three of Italy’s rowers, Romano Sgheiz, Fulvio Balatti, and Giovanni Zucchi, were bronze medalists from the 1960 Olympic coxed fours event (and Sgheiz was a champion from the same event in 1956) and, with Luciano Sgheiz, had won silver and bronze at the 1963 and 1964 European Championships respectively. The race for podium spots was close and exciting: just over two seconds separated the surprise gold medalists, Denmark, from the bronze medal-winning Americans, with the Britons sandwiched in-between with silver. This was the former rowing power of Great Britain’s first Olympic medal since 1948, as well as Denmark’s first gold medal since then.

He cruised through the heat and semi-final, each time marking his nearest rival until a finishing kick asserted his dominance to both crowd and opponents. Weissmuller lost time to a poor start and although he trailed the surprise of the event, István Bárány of Hungary, early in the race, the American moved ahead only for the Hungarian to surge again and close the gap on the leader. Weissmuller’s superior turning technique gained him time on his rival and he moved away to victory. It should be mentioned that a conflicting report on the race states that Weissmuller actually lost time coming out of the turn as he swallowed a large gulp of water and became briefly disorientated before regaining his composure. He trained for the Los Angeles Games of 1932 but he was enticed by Hollywood and went to play the part of “Tarzan” in motion pictures for the next fifteen years. Although his acting abilities were somewhat limited, he remains to this day an iconic figure in movie history.

In 1932, the Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS) had decided to permit instructors to compete in international competitions. At the IOC Session in Oslo in the winter of 1935, the IOC informed the FIS that paid ski instructors would not be allowed to participate in the Winter Olympics. One of the victims of this decision was the Austrian skier Toni Seelos, world champion in Alpine Combination in 1935. Seelos was also the coach for Christel Cranz, who won the women’s Alpine Combination in the 1936 games. According to contemporary reports, Seelos was a test skier in the first round in the slalom event in the Olympic Winter Games, and recorded a time 6 seconds better than the fastest time in the competition! Austria and Switzerland declined to enter a team in the men’s event in protest against the IOC decision to exclude the ski instructors from the Olympics.
Among the entries, he silver medalist in the combination at the 1936 World Championships, the French skier Émile Allais from Megève, was among the hottest names, together with the German favorites Franz Pfnür (gold in 1935 downhill) and Gustav Lantscher, the Austrian-born world champion in the 1932 downhill who received German citizenship in 1935. The home favorite Roman Wörndle and 17-year-old Rudi Cranz, the little brother of the Olympic champion Christel Cranz, completed the strong German team. Unlike Laila Schou Nilsen, the Norwegian Birger Ruud, Olympic champion in ski jumping 1932, was also a well known name among the alpine skiers. He won bronze in the Alpine Combined at the 1935 World Championships, and knew the slopes of Kreuzjoch quite well, since he had stayed in Garmisch for several months during the last two years, working as a very popular assistant in a local sport shop.
The men’s downhill course was 3,800 m. with a descent of 959 m., and the competition started at noon, one hour after the start of the women’s race. The four best placed in the competition were the first four to finish, and were the only competitors able to break the 5 minute barrier. With start number 1, Lantschner crossed the finishing line in 4:58.2. The next skier Allais came close, recording 4:58.8. With start number 3, Ruud made an excellent time of 4:47.4, taking the lead with a +10 second’s margin.  Pfnür, with start number 5, was unable to beat the Norwegian, but with the second best time of 4:51.8 he was in good position before the slalom event.
Two days later the slalom event was organized in Gudiberg, and the start and finishing points were the same as for the women the day before. The men however had to negotiate 33 gates, 10 more than the ladies. In the first round Ruud spoiled his medal chances by missing a gate – he had to climb back and also received a 6 seconds penalty – giving him a time over 20 seconds behind the leader. Pfnür had the best time in both rounds and won the gold medal easily. Lantschner secured a German double by keeping ahead of Allais in both rounds. Home favorite Wörndle was given a 6 seconds penalty in the second round and was unable to catch Ruud, and the young and talented Cranz was out of contention for medals after a 12 second penalty in the first round.  In the second round he was only 0.1 seconds behind the champion Pfnür.  Six years later both Wörndle and Cranz had become victims of the World War II, both losing their lives on the Eastern front as soldiers in the Wehrmacht.

Korshunova posted the fastest time in the opening round, while Poland’s Ewa Kamińska-Eichler bested Zirzow and helped relegate Mihoreanu to the repêchage in the other heat.

The American Olympic Team contested metric events at Saranac Lake prior to leaving for Europe, the fastest sprinter being Charley Jewtraw with 46.6. But as an indication of his speed, Jewtraw had also set a new World Record in the 100 yard (9.4) on January 6th.

Moore’s time went unchallenged until the 11th pair, when Asser Wallenius (44.4 in Davos) stopped the clock at 45 seconds, only to see it improved with 8 tenths by Oskar Olsen in the next race. Defending World Champion Thunberg was unable to beat this time with 44.8. Two North Americans contested pair 15, Charles Jewtraw and Charlie Gorman.

The only remaining favorite, Larsen, had to skate against a much slower opponent, and also timed 44.8, tying for third place with Clas Thunberg.
Jewtraw had been a top skater in the short distances in the early 1920s. Coming from a poor family, speed skating was expensive, but Jewtraw was “sponsored” by Lake Placid businessman Jack Mabbit. He grew to become one of the fastest skaters in the very short distances, which were primarily contested in North America.

Nobody could really envision how close, although Sports Illustrated’s Craig Neff did call it, predicting in the Olympic Preview issue, “The West Germans will likely lose their world record and the gold medal to the U.S. – but just barely.” That record went in the heats as the US B team came home in 7:18.87 for a world record to qualify first.
US coach Don Gambril made the choice to lead off with America’s best, Mike Heath, and make the Germans catch up, as the German anchor would certainly be Michael Groß, probably the top male freestyler in Los Angeles. On the first leg Heath went ahead of Thomas Fahrner, 1:48.67 to 1:49.83. On the next leg David Larson extended the lead to 2.87 seconds at 300 metres, but he had gone out too fast, and Dirk Korthals closed so that the US lead was only 9/10ths of a second by the exchange. The third US swimmer, Jeff Float, also went out quickly and had 3 seconds on the Germans at 500 metres, but Alexander Schowtka reeled in Float on the second 100, with the margin 1.56 seconds as the anchor swimmers started their work.
Groß anchored Germany, as expected, and he faced off against American Bruce Hayes. At the first turn of the anchor, Groß had caught up, but Gambril later noted that “Groß paid too much to catch Bruce that early.” For the next 100 they swam together, Groß unable to shake Hayes, until Germany took a slight lead at the final turn. With 25 metres to go, Hayes had made that up and they swam together to the wall, nobody really knowing who had won, until the scoreboard showed that it was the United States – 7:15.69 to 7:15.73 – the closest relay in Olympic swimming history. The time was a world record by over three seconds.
Groß was magnanimous in defeat, stating, “I simply did not have any more to give. We never expected to swim so fast in the relay, so we cannot be too disappointed.” His final leg of 1:46.89 was the fastest 200 split ever recorded at that time.

The Soviet-led boycott had minimal effect in 1984, with East German Siegfried Stark the only top international decathlete absent. Despite the German threat, Thompson was superb.

He led Hingsen by 210 points after the javelin and coasted in the 1,500 to win the gold medal. Hingsen, Wentz, and Kratschmer finished second, third, and fourth.

The organizers initially awarded the title by forfeit to the New York team of Charles Tatham, Van Zo Post, Fitzhugh Townsend, and Scott O’Connor but they refused, stating they did not come to win prizes but to promote fencing in this section of the country, and they asked that the event be postponed to allow the Chicago team time to arrive. A large crowd had come to see fencing and applauded this show of sportsmanship by the New York fencers. The New York fencers then gave several exhibition bouts of fencing for the spectators. The event was re-scheduled for 8 September and was finally held on that date.

Pilots Christophe Langen and Wolfgang Hoppe of Germany had been joined on the podium at the1 993 World Championship by 1992 Olympic champion Gustav Weder of Switzerland but the Hoppe would compete at Lillehammer only in the four-man event and Langen would not make the team at a ll. This left Weder as one of the favourites alongside Italian, German, Canadian and American crews.
As the event progressed it became apparent that the gold medal would be decided between the Swiss crews piloted by Weder and Reto Götschi. Gotschi held a small advantage of just 0.03 of a second over Weder when he left the start hut at the beginning of the fourth run and held his advantage for most of the course. At the final intermediate timing some 200 m from the finish the splits showed the two crews as equal down to the exact 100th but Götschi dropped a further 0.02 on his way to the finish. It was a bitter sweet ending for the Acklin family as Donat Acklin served as Gustav Weder’s brakeman whilst his brother Guido served the same role for Reto Götschi.  Italy I finished clear of the top German sled for the bronze medal shutting Germany out of the medals for the first time in thirty years.

But the medal race was all New Zealand, locking up the gold medal early in the final contest, as the British crew was caught on the wrong side of a big wind shift on the first leg and would drop back to silver. In addition, the very light winds of the medal race caused the committee to shorten it, making the New Zealand lead unassailable.

Bragg was joined on the US team by outsiders Lindy Remigino and Dean Smith. Their biggest opposition was felt to come from Jamaica’s Herb McKenley and Britain’s McDonald Bailey. The final in Helsinki is probably the closest mass finish in Olympic 100 metre history. Bragg did not make the final, but Smith, Remigino, McKenley, and Bailey were joined by Vladimir Sukharev of the USSR, and John Treloar of Australia. Remigino got out to an early lead but McKenley came on strong at the end and it was difficult to tell who had won. But McKenley’s fast finish saw him pass Remigino in the metres after the line, leading many observers to think the Jamaican had won. The photo finish was necessary to separate the runners, with Remigino winning gold, McKenley silver, and Bailey bronze. Smith, Sukharyev, and Treloar finished 4-6.

Italian Federica Pellegrini, at only 16-years-old, burst into contention for the title when she easily won the first semi-final with Solenne Figuès of France winning the second semi in a much slower time. As the early leaders dropped away in the final Pellegrini and Figuès battled away for the lead in the middle lanes and what seemed to be an Olympic title for one of them.

Challenging him would be defending Olympic champion Matthias Steiner of Germany and Ruslan Albegov of Russia, the reigning European Champion. Salimi’s compatriot Sajjad Anoushiravani was also in the running for a medal as runner-up at the most recent World Championships and bronze medalist at the 2012 Asian Championships and 2010 Asian Games.
In the snatch, Salimi and Albegov both lifted 208 kg and, by virtue of his far lighter body weight, gave the Russian a slight advantage going into the clean and jerk. Only two other competitors managed weights of over 200 kg: Anoushiravani (204 kg) and Irak’li Turmanidze of Georgia (201 kg). Steiner lifted 192 kg on his first lift and then went for 196 kg for his second attempt, but was unsuccessful and, as he dropped the weight, it came down on the back of his neck. Although he was not seriously injured in the accident, he was unable to compete any further and dropped out. In the clean and jerk Anoushiravani took an early lead with a 237 kg lift and was soon followed by Albegov, who lifted 240 kg to take first place. The Iranian responded with a 245 kg lift to retake the gold medal position while Jeon Sang-Gyun of South Korea, 2010 Asian Games runner-up and 2011 world bronze medalist, lifted 246 kg to slide into the final podium spot. Salimi then entered with a successful attempt at 247 kg, enough to give him a six point lead in the competition. Albegov was unable to match this and thus remained in third, albeit a comfortable 12 points head of Jeon, the only remaining competitor who could knock him off the podium. While he was waiting, Anoushiravani tried a 251 kg lift to pass Salimi but was unsuccessful, settling for silver. Jeon returned with the 259 kg attempt he needed to pass Albegov, but failed and was left out of the medals. Salimi, now guaranteed gold, chose 264 kg for his second lift and tried to surpass the world record for the clean and jerk. Unsuccessful, he bowed out of a third attempt and went home an Olympic champion.

Although it would appear that the rest of the world had caught up to the USA in men’s basketball, the USA team at the Athens Worlds consisted of lesser-known pros. The US again chose an NBA All-Star team to represent them in Sydney and it was expected that they would again win easily. Among European teams, there was no consensus favorite to overtake the Americans. At the 1998 Worlds, Russia had won the silver medal, while the podiums had been mounted at the 1997 Europeans by Yugoslavia, Italy and Russia, but in 1999, Italy won the European Championship, with Spain second, and Yugoslavia third. Lithuania had finished no better than fifth at those preliminary international contests.
The US opened the Sydney tournament with two easy wins over China and Italy. But then they faced Lithuania and won by only 85-76. However, the US was undefeated in Group A and went to the quarter-finals, where they handily defeated Russia, 85-70. The semi-finals saw a re-match against Lithuania, and the myth of American basketball dominance would finally end – probably forever.
Lithuania did not win. But with 1:36 left in the game, former University of Maryland player Šarūnas Jasikevičius sank two free throws to give Lithuania an 80-79 lead. The USA responded and pulled ahead 84-81. But Jasikevičius sank a short jump shot with a bit over 9 seconds left, to cut the lead to one point. Lithuania fouled Jason Kidd, who hit one free throw but missed the second. Jasikevičius then came downcourt and launched a 22-foot 3-point attempt, going for the win. It missed, and the USA won, 85-83.
In the final, the US took an early lead against France. But midway thru the second half, France also laughed in the face of American hoops dominance, and cut the lead to four points with just over four minutes. The American team responded, however, and won 85-75, finishing the tournament undefeated and winning another gold medal. But things were no longer the same in international basketball.

Unfortunately, in round two, his horse, Baloubet du Rouet, balked and refused three times at obstacle seven, eliminating the pair.
This allowed two of the riders who had gone clean in round one, Jeroen Dubbeldam (NED) and Khaled Al-Eid (KSA) to tie with a total of 4.00 faults, joined by another Dutch rider, Albert Voorn, who had a clean ride in round two. The three jumped off to decide the medal and Dubbeldam again went clear to win the gold medal. Both Voorn and Al-Eid had four faults, but Voorn won the silver based on time, 44.72 to 44.86. Al-Eid’s bronze medal was the first ever won in equestrianism by Saudi Arabia. For Pessoa, he would get his gold medal, but would wait four years, winning at Athina in 2004.

All the leading riders later turned professional.  Armstrong had one of the greatest cycling careers ever, winning seven consecutive Tours de France (1999-2005).  Dekker became a solid professional rider in the peleton, winning four stages at the Tour de France and the 2001 Amstel Gold Race.  Ozols rode professionally from 1995-2000, winning a stage in the 1996 Peace Race.
Fabio Casartelli eventually became a domestique on the Motorola team and supported Armstrong in the 1995 Tour de France.  On the 15th stage of that race, he went off a curve in the Pyrenees, while descending the Col de Portet d’Aspet, and hit his un-helmeted head on a concrete pylon.  Doctors were quickly on the scene but he died almost instantly. The next day, the peleton allowed Motorola teammate Armstrong to ride away uncontested to victory, in Casartelli’s memory.

In the running season, World Cup races had also been won by Dustin Molicki, Derek Parra and Petter Andersen. The latter had shared his victory with Jakko Jan Leeuwangh, who didn’t even make the Dutch team, as had Martin Hersman and Erben Wennemars, also World Cup medalists earlier in the season.
Not among those favorites was Jochem Uytdehaage, whose selection at the Dutch Olympic Trials had been somewhat controversial due to his lack of previous achievements at the distance. But with an Olympic gold medal from the 5,000 m in the pocket, the Dutchman skated the best 1,500 m of his life. With the best final lap of the competition, he broke Lee Gyu-Hyeok’s world record and lowered it to 1:44.57. Of the pre-race favorites, only one man was able to beat this time. Having finished second behind Uytdehaage in the 5,000 m, Derek Parra now took home the gold. A former inline skating World Champion, he had switched to speed skating in 1996 for a chance to compete in the Olympics. Having been an alternate in 1998, his results slowly improved, winning his first international prize at the 2001 World Single Distance Champions; a silver medal in the 1,500 m. He confirmed his status in that event by winning a World Cup race in November 2001, his only international win prior to his Olympic title.
The duel for the bronze was an interesting one, between Søndrål and Joey Cheek. Primarily a sprinter, Cheek had taken off incredibly fast, leading Parra’s splits by four tenths at the bell, and Søndrål by a full 1.75 seconds. As Cheek struggled on the final lap, Søndrål made up for the difference, beating the American by just 0.08 at the finish line.

They were World Champions in 1989-90 and European Champions in 1989-92, although they had survived a doping scare in 1991, when Klimova was accused until her B-sample proved clean. But the most interesting couple was the French team of Isabelle and her brother, Paul Duchesnay. Born in Québec, they had French citizenship and were trained in Germany, with their choreography done by Christopher Dean, of the famed Torvill & Dean dance couple. The Duchesnays, who started out as pairs skaters, completely revolutionized ice dancing with routines that pushed the limits of the rules, and were totally innovative. For years the judges punished them with seemingly low marks, as they wanted more traditional skating. But finally they came thru and won the World Championships in 1991 in München. But in Albertville, the Duchesnays got off poorly, placing third in the compulsory dances behind Klimova/Ponomarenko, and another former Soviet couple – Maya Usova and Aleksandr Zhulin. Klimova and Ponomarenko also won the optional set pattern dance, with the Duchesnays second, which moved them into second place going into the free dance. And the free dance was very close, won by Klimova and Ponomarenko, to earn them the gold medal. They were ranked first by five judges to four for the Duchesnays.

Mathis had impressed as much with his hand speed as his power in the US trials and he seemed a certainty for Olympic gold but Mathis never got to travel to Tokyo, let alone fight for gold. A hand injury forced his withdrawal and he was replaced by Joe Frazier, the man he defeated to clinch a place on the Olympic team. Frazier took his opportunity with gusto and made quick work of his first two opponents. A sterner test appeared to wait in the shape of Soviet sailor Vadim Yemelyanov in the semi-final but the only difference this time was that the humiliation lasted an extra round and that Yemelyanov was a resilient punch bag. Opposing Frazier in the final was the experienced Hans Huber of Germany.  Huber had noted Frazier’s performances and attempted to use his speed and footwork to negate the American’s punching ability. The fight reached the final bell and two of the judges agreed that Huber had succeeded in his mission but the three others voted in favour of Frazier and the American took the gold medal home.
Frazier turned professional in the aftermath of the Games and, though overshadowed by the exploits of Muhammad Ali, established himself as one the all-time legends of his sport. He became heavyweight champion of the world in 1967, ironically by beating his old rival Buster Mathis, and four years later became the first man to defeat Ali in the “Fight of the Century“ at Madison Square Garden in New York. He lost his crown and his undefeated record to George Foreman in 1973 and lost a rematch to Ali early the following year. A third fight with Ali, “The Thrilla in Manilla“, is perhaps rated as the greatest, and most brutal, fight of all time.

Then in 1988, again with a solid chance at gold, he failed to even make the US Olympic team. After Seoul he retired from swimming and entered Cornell Law School, but in November 1991, after his mother’s death he was inspired to return to the pool, and was able to make the US team for Barcelona, despite training for less than a year.
In the prelims, Morales led with 53.59, followed closely by Poland’s Rafał Szukała. Morales led out in the final, and appeared to have the gold, but the Pole came on strongly at the end and the result was in doubt, until the scoreboard showed that Morales had won by 0.03 seconds, with Szukała second.

The pre-Olympic favorites were both British - George Larner who had won both walks at the 1908 Olympics, and had won the AAA 7-mile walk in 1911, and Ernie Webb who had won the AAA 7-mile walk in 1908-1910, and was the silver medalist in both walks at the 1908 Olympics.  The world best in 1912 was 45:43.5 set by Paul Gunia (GER) in Berlin on 24 October 1908.  For unknown reasons, neither Larner nor Gunia competed and in their absence, Webb was expected to win easily.
But Webb could not match Canada’s George Goulding, who had also competed at the 1908 Olympics.  At London, Goulding had placed 4th in the 3,500 metre walk, did not finish in his heat of the 10 mile walk, and also ran the marathon, finishing 22nd.  However, since 1908, Goulding had greatly improved and had beaten Webb at match races in Toronto in the summer of 1910.  After winning the gold medal, Goulding’s first act was to send a telegram to his wife.  It read only, “Won - George.”
But Goulding spoke more of the final, as given in Henry Roxborough’s Canada at the Olympics, “In the final, I took the lead right from the start.  When I was about 40 yards ahead of Webb, I thought the judges were after me.  One of them said something in Swedish which I didn’t understand; but when I turned toward him I saw a broad grin on his face and concluded he must have said something nice.  Still, it was a ticklish moment, for the judges had the right to pull anyone off the track without previous warnings.  With other judges, I could have improved my time; but during the last mile, when I had a lead of about 75 yards, I slowed considerably and took no chance of being disqualified.  Besides, in the first heat, I had rubbed the skin off my toes, while wearing almost new shoes; and in the final my feet were really torturing.  However, in winning, I soon forgot the pain and remembered only the pleasure.”

Not one of the medallists from the 1965 Worlds was present at Grenoble whilst both the 1966 and 1967 championships were abandoned.
The tragic death of Germany’s Toni Pensburger curtailed the 1966 event whilst adverse weather conditions meant that the next year’s championships were never even started.
Eugenio Monti of Italy had defeated his Olympic jinx in the two man event and entered the four man competition as favourite despite it being seven years since his last world title in the event. 
The weather again threatened to ruin proceedings but after two days were abandoned the racing eventually got underway albeit restricted to two runs instead of the scheduled four.  Monti did not disappoint and posted the fastest time of the first run. Behind him were the Austria I quartet piloted by Edwin Thaler and the second Italian crew. The fastest times of the second run was posted by Switzerland I, which moved them into the bronze medal position, and by Thaler’s Austrians but Monti was not to be denied. His lead was cut to less than a tenth of a second but that was sufficient to make sure that he became the first man to win both bobsleigh events at a single Winter Games.
This was the last race of Monti’s illustrious career which had seen him gather nine world titles in addition to his six Olympic medals and a reputation for fair play. He retired from competition to pursue his business interests but stayed in the sport as manager of the Italian team. After suffering from Parkinson’s disease for close on two decades Monti ended his own life in 2003.
Further down the field were two men who found success in the world of motor racing. Both Boris Said, Jr of the United States and Briton Robin Widdows competed at the top level of the sport and participated in Formula One Grand Prix races.

Ledecky led the heats in 1:55.28 just ahead of Canada’s Penny Oleksiak, but Titmus was the fastest semi-finalist, finishing in 1:54.82, with Ledecky in third, also behind Hong Kong’s Siobhán Haughey, with Oleksiak qualifying sixth for the final.
Oleksiak led the finalists through 50 metres in 26.50 when Haughey took over and led through 150 metres, with China’s Yang Junxuan in second, Titmus in third, and Oleksiak fourth. Ledecky was never a factor and was never better than fifth place at any split, where she would finish.
As Yang faded on the last lap, Titmus came through with her typical fast finish, splitting 28.80 to win the gold medal in 1:53.50 for an Olympic record. Behind her, Haughey won Hong Kong’s first ever Olympic medal in swimming, a silver, and Oleksiak filled out the podium with a bronze, as Yang finished fourth.

With no seeding it was always possible that two of the favourites could be drawn to meet each other and that is exactly what happened in the first round in Munich. Seales was drawn against the reigning European Champion, Ulrich Beyer of East Germany. The bout lived up to expectations as first Seales and then Beyer took the upper hand over the course of the fight. The fight was effectively decided in the last minute when Seales launched a blistering attack which shook his opponent to his boots. It was enough give the American the win in the eyes of three of the five judges. Despite another close call in the quarter-finals Seales advanced to the final where he would face Angel Angelov of Bulgaria. The gold medal bout was a textbook clash between the upright technical Eastern European style of Angelov and the looser, more aggressive American. With little to choose between the two men the decisive moment came in the first round when Seales knocked the Bulgarian to the floor. After the Olympics Seales embarked on a professional career. He fought some of the best boxers in the middleweight division including world champions Marvin Hagler and Alan Minter but, although he held the North American championships, never managed to get a shot at the world title. He suffered serious damage to his retina during his career and was declared legally blind in the mid-eighties. Seales later worked with autistic high school students.

In this case, however, the reigning Olympic champions and winners of the event in two of the last three World Championships, Romania’s Ivan Patzaichin  and Toma Simionov, were present in Los Angeles to defend their crown. In the opening round they won their heat by over 12 seconds, while the Yugoslavian duo of Matija Ljubek and Mirko Nišović, the 1982 World runners-up and 1983 bronze medalists, took the other. The Yugoslavians put forth an impressive effort in the final, but the Romanians were in control the entire time and won gold with nearly a second to spare, leaving Ljubek and Nišović with silver. This was a reversal of the result from the C-2 500, in which Patzaichin and Simionov were runners-up to the Yugoslavians.

The reigning World Champions, they had a strong showing in the pre-season, winning two of the three World Cup races, while placing second to Russian in the third. Not only did the Canadians have several star skaters, they had also trained exhaustively for the event, still relatively new. But the competition delivered surprise after surprise.
First, the strong Russian team suffered a shock quarter-final defeat at the hands of Poland, after one of the Russians fell behind in the later stages of the race. Then, it was the unheralded Americans who silenced the Canadian crowd by beating the favorites. Canada had been leading with ease, but had not paid attention to the splits of their opponents, and had failed to accelerate.
The second semi-final provided even more excitement. Defending champion Germany was facing the Americans, and they had a solid lead for most of the race. But their star skater, Anni Friesinger-Postma, who had almost been left out of the team due to poor shape caused by injury, struggled in the final lap. While trying to close the gap with ther team mates, Friesinger fell in sight of the finish line. With swimming motions and by turning her skates towards the line, the Germans nevertheless managed to finish ahead of the Americans.
In the final, Germany faced Japan, which had reached the final with relative ease. The Japanese opened up a large lead over the Germans, who raced without Friesinger. But the three Asians totally collapsed in the final lap, resulting in a photo finish. Germany came out the winners, with just 0.02 separating gold and silver. The bronze medal race was also remarkable. The Americans brought in Catherine Raney-Norman, which eventually cost them the bronze. She couldn’t follow the pace of the Americans, who were leading up to that point. The Polish team, of which even the best skater (Katarzyna Bachleda-Curuś) rarely featured in the top-10 of international competitions, thus won a completely unexpected bronze medal. It was the first bronze medal since 1960, when Poland had claimed two medals in the sport’s début for women.

The lead after the press was taken on bodyweight by Albanian Ymer Pampuri, who worked as a circus clown and was completely unknown. He would place last in the snatch, which was excusable when one understands he had never performed that lift in competition prior to the 1972 Olympics. Pampuri was tied after the press with Bulgarian Norair Nurikyan and Soviet Georgian Dito Shanidze, the 1968 Olympic silver medalist. Shanidze moved ahead after the snatch with Nurikyan 2.5 kg behind, tied with Hungarian János Benedek. In the clean & jerk, Nurikyan lifted 157.5 kg for a world record, which gave him a total of 402.5 kg, to equal Shanidze’s world record and win the gold medal.

In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
All eight members of the Russian bobsleigh teams, which originally finished first and fourth in this event were disqualified in November-December 2017. Appeals were made immediately to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but were partially denied and the Russian teams remained disqualified and the medals were re-allocated.
A special committee of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) was then charged with investigating these findings, but refused to acknowledge the disqualifications and allowed all the sliders to continue competing. The IOC was not happy with that ruling and the Executive Committee of the IBSF then appealed to the CAS, against its own sub-committee, to have that ruling overturned.

In the opening round, however, it was the Polish team who had the fastest time, facing stiffer competition in their heat against the Americans than the Italians had with the Germans. It was Germany, however, who, along with New Zealand, would escape the repêchage, while the United States was eliminated. The final was a close race between Germany and Italy, but the Germans managed to take the lead right at the end and claim victory by a mere 0.2 seconds, leaving Italy with silver. Poland, meanwhile, finished comfortably ahead of New Zealand to claim bronze.

That left the way for three men to seriously challenge for the podium places. One was the 2015, and reigning, World champion Shi Zhiyong of China. Another contender was the 2015 World bronze medalist and 2016 European champion Daniýar Ismaýilow of Turkey, and Kim Myong-Hyok of Korea, fourth at the 2012 Olympic Games, was the third man to be amongst the favourites for a medal. Based on being named the outstanding lifter at the 2016 Pan American Championships, where his total of 336 kg was more than Ismaýilow ‘s 333 kg winning lift at the European Championships, Bredni Roque, a former Cuban, competing for Mexico, was considered a serious outsider with a medal chance.
A lot of lifters were going bold with their starting weights in the snatch, which resulted in Ketut Ariana of Indonesia bombing out early. Kim, failed with all his clean and jerk attempts. Luís Javier Mosquera of Colombia took the lead with three lifters remaining, setting a new personal best at 155 kg, but Shi was on a mission, and Ismaýilow was not going to make it easy. After a 162 kg snatch, Shi clinched the gold medal with a 190 kg clean & jerk for a 352 kg total, holding off the challenge by Ismaýilow (formerly of Turkmenistan) who made six good lifts and lost the gold by just one kilo. Shi attempted an Olympic record in the clean & jerk, but was unsuccessful.
With this Olympic win, Shi became an Olympic champion just like the man whose name he was given when he was a teenager. At that time, his coach, two-time Olympic champion Zhan Xugang, renamed him after the elder Shi Zhiyong, the 2004 Olympic champion and national hero.
Ismaýilow, who had finished 13th at the 2012 Olympic Games, took home the silver medal. Izzat Artykov who first entered international competition in 2010 in the lightest category (56 kg), and whose strength had improved enormously over the years, won the bronze medal with a 339 kg total. It was the first Olympic weightlifting medal for Kyrgyzstan, but he was subsequently disqualified after testing positive for strychnine. Mosquera was upgraded to bronze.

It had been designed in Europe and was chosen over the Windsurfer One, designed in America by Hoyle Schwitzer, which was used for the men’s and women’s demonstration event. The windglider would never be used again for Olympic windsurfing. The windsurfers raced over the Alpha course in the Long Beach Harbor.
The first gold medal in windsurfing went to Dutchman Stephan van den Berg, who won only one race, but was consistent, not having to count any race finish higher than fourth. Silver medalist Scott Steele of the United States was competing in his only Olympics. The bronze medalist, Bruce Kendall of New Zealand, would win this event in 1988. His sister, Barbara, was one the world’s top women windsurfers and won a full set of Olympic medals in the women’s event at the 1992-2000 Olympics, including gold in 1992.
Van Den Berg had won four world titles (1980-83) on the Windglider, the first three in the Light division, which was eliminated in 1983. He turned professional after the Olympics, but returned in 1992 when pros were allowed to compete.

The rules in force were those of the United States, rather than Britain.  The jury had a difficult time deciding who was putting the shot and who was throwing it, the primary offender apparently being the Finn, Verner Järvinen, who was favored in Rose/Horgan’s absence, but had no fair efforts.

With the Olympics in the United States, the media interest in this attempt was enormous, but Lewis was actually a solid favorite in all three individual events, and only a dropped baton or bad pass could hamper him in the relay.

The favorite was Ole Einar Bjørndalen, who had already won the 20 km and 10 km sprint in Salt Lake City, and thus started with a 29-second lead.

USA Basketball responded by hiring Jerry Colangelo, a former NBA coach, to lead Team USA and Colangelo hired Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, who instituted a team program concept. This worked with a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics and in 2010 the USA won the World Championships for only the second time ever. Led by NBA stars Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul, the USA was favored in London, but they knew that they could be beaten if they did not play well, as Spain, Russia, and Argentina had several NBA players on their teams.

In addition, she had broken the world record in the sprint combination at test races in Davos in January, skating well below 40 seconds on both 500 metres. But competition was to be expected from China’s Ye Qiaobo, the runner-up at the 1991 World Sprint Championships and winner of a World Cup race in Albertville, and the Netherlands’ Christine Aaftink, who had twice been runner-up at World Cups. The German women were also not to be forgotten, notably Christa Luding (the 1988 Olympic 1,000 m champion), Angela Hauck, and Monique Garbrecht, World Sprint Champions of 1990 and 1991, respectively.
Skating in the first pair, Aaftink’s medal chances were slashed after a poor final curve and 40.66. That time was promptly beaten by Ye with 40.51. She might have done better, as she appeared to be obstructed by pairmate Yelena Tyushnyakova, but no re-skate was allowed. Despite better openers than the Chinese, both Luding and Garbrecht failed to beat Ye’s final time, clocking 40.57 and 40.63. The fifth pair then saw Blair pull away from Hauck, beating her easily and winning the race in 40.33. For Blair, it was her second gold medal in a career that would eventually earn her five Olympic titles. Ye’s silver medal was notable as it was China’s first ever Olympic medal at the Winter Olympics. Four years earlier, she had missed the Olympics due to a doping offense at the World Sprint Championships. In Albertville she declared this was due to drugs given to her by the team doctor, whom she had trusted.

Here he redeemed himself with the fastest leg of the competition, narrowly ahead of Australia’s Kyle Chalmers (46.95 – 46.96). Apple’s anchor brought the Americans home for gold, winning in 3:26.78, taking more than a second off the world record they had set at Rio in 2016.
Behind the Americans, Great Britain held on comfortably for silver, with Italy edging out the Russian Olympic Committee team for the bronze medal. For Caeleb Dressel, this was his fifth gold medal of the 2020 Olympics, the dominant male swimming performance at Tokyo.

The first two runs were taken by Hackl but his lead over Prock was limited to just a hundredth of a second at half way. The third run changed things around as the German could not quite match Prock’s speed and the Austrian rose to the gold medal position, but this was a position he could not hang on to permanently. Prock’s time on the final run was only seventh fastest and the clock stopped to reveal that Hackl had retained his title by a miniscule nine hundreths of a second. Hackl became the first man in history to successfully defend an Olympic singles title. In his first Olympic Games Italian Armin Zöggeler took home the bronze meal. This was a task made considerably easier by the crash that ended the hopes of America’s Duncan Kennedy on the third run.

That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended.

This was one of the many events affected.
This original result would stand for five years but in 2013 it was announced that  a retest of a urine sample given by Mikhnevich at the 2005 IAAF World Athletics Championships had, with the use of updated testing techniques, revealed the presence of no less than three banned substances. Since the Belarussian had previously served a doping ban between 2001 and 2003, this second offense was punishable by a lifetime suspension and all of his performances since the 2005 World Championships were automatically voided by the IAAF.  In 2014 the Canadian Olympic Committee announced that the IOC had confirmed that Armstrong was promoted to the bronze medal position in place of Mikhnevich. Armstrong received his bronze medal on 15 February 2015, in his hometown of Kamloops, British Columbia, almost 7 years after the event had ended.

Klim had already put his marker down by setting a world record in the first leg of the 4 x 100 freestyle relay.

Some sources state that Tom Nicolson arrived late and did not compete in the qualifying and a petition by the other contestants allowed him to compete in the finals. Gazet van Antwerpen states that Nicolson qualified for the final by throwing in a special trial later in the afternoon. Thus, it would seem that there were seven athletes advanced to the final, instead of the original six, as the rules stated.

You cannot summarize it more clearly than did the 1984 Olympic edition of Swimming World, which noted, “1) He became the first man ever to score over 700, shattering the all-time best he set in the prelims of 688.05 and bettering the record prior to the Olympics of 687.90, a score he did at the 1983 FINA World Cup; 2) He won the platform by the largest margin in Olympic history, finishing 67.41 points ahead of teammate Bruce Kimball, the silver medalist. 3) He became the first male diver to sweep the Olympic diving events since Pete Desjardins of the USA in 1928 and only the third [male] ever. Louganis averaged a score of over 8.9 per dive. He never received a counting score under 8 and didn’t have a counting score under 9 on seven of his 10 dives.” His coach, Ron O’Brien, said, “It was absolutely the most dominating diving display in history. Some reporter asked me to compare it to a performance in another sport. I’d say it’s like someone going 30 feet in the long jump or running the 100 meters in 9.5.”
Bruce Kimball’s silver medal was not unexpected but was a major comeback for a man whose life was a soap opera. A platform specialist, he had been bronze medalist at the 1982 World Championships and silver medalist behind Louganis at the 1983 Pan American Games. These occurred after a car accident in 1981 when he was struck head-on by a drunk driver and suffered multiple injuries, including several facial fractures, a broken femur, torn knee ligaments, a lacerated liver, and his spleen had to be removed. He was called “The Comeback Kid” for his efforts to return to the tower.
Kimball also won a bronze medal at the 1986 World Championships. He was expected to medal again at the 1988 Olympics until 1 August 1988 when he went to a bar and had about 12 beers. By then Kimball was drinking a lot and using cocaine. After leaving the bar he got in his car and was speeding down a road in Florida, where he had been training, when he plowed the car into a group of teenagers, killing two instantly, and injuring several others quite severely. He later pleaded guilty to two counts of vehicular manslaughter and was sentenced to 17 years in prison, of which he served five, and he permanently lost his driver’s license. Kimball actually competed at the 1988 US Olympic Trials, which was quite controversial, but did not make the team.
Chinese diver Li Kongzheng won the bronze medal followed by his teammate Tong Hui. Their coach Xu Yiming was unhappy that they did not win gold or silver and said of Louganis, “[He] is an excellent diver but has his shortcomings and new divers will solve those and pass him.” Nobody was quite sure what those shortcomings were.

A penalty at the start put the Argentinian boat to the back of the field, but they recovered and advanced to sixth place at the finish line outperforming their Italian rivals by one place, and by just seven seconds, which proved to be decisive. Eventually, the medal hopefuls Italy dropped to fifth place overall. The other three leading catamarans from Austria, Australia and New Zealand occupied the top three positions in the medal race.

But while Kim skated around with the Korean flag, it was announced that Kim was disqualified for cross-tracking, for obstructing Ohno who was trying to pass him. The call left Kim in disbelief on the ice, while Ohno ecstatically celebrated his victory with the crowd.
Disputed disqualifications are not uncommon in short track, and naturally one deciding the Olympic gold was hotly disputed. The referee’s decision fell badly with South Koreans, and Ohno and the IOC received thousands of e-mails and letters, some even containing death threats. Ohno was assigned body guards because of this, and still needs protection when competing in South Korea, where short track speed skating is a major sport. The impact of the decision was visible during the 2002 Football World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan. When Ahn Jung-Hwan scored the equaliser in a match between South Korea and the US, he celebrated his goal by making skating moves, later explaining the reference to Kim’s disqualification. Kim himself would bounce back in the best way possible. At the 2002 World Championships, after the Games, he won all four distances and the overall title - an unprecedented performance.

The gold went to Chen Jing, who was only 21-years-old and had little international experience. Chen would later defect to Taiwan (Chinese Taipei in the Olympic Movement) and represent that nation at the 1996 and 2000 Olympics. He Zhili would also emigrate, settling in Japan, where she took the name Chire Koyama, and she also competed at the 1996 and 2000 Olympics. The bronze medalist in 1988 was Jiao Zhimin.

Defending champion Lee Seung-Hoon had been a world champion in short track, as had the #2 in the World Cup ranking, Ruslan Zakharov. Three-time world champion Joey Mantia was a 28-time world champion in inline speed skating, while the Belgian leader in the World Cup was Bart Swings, who held 15 titles in that sport. Outsider Jorrit Bergsma, the 2020 world champion, was also a former Dutch champion in marathon skating.
The main surprise of the semi-finals was the elimination of Zakharov. The 2014 Olympic short track champion suffered a fall and was unable to qualify. The final was dominated by Swings. He personally quashed all run-away attempts. With two laps to go, Bergsma sped up for a long sprint, but most of the pack was able to follow. At the bell, Swings took the lead, only to be quickly overtaken by Lee. The Korean still headed the field as Swings passed him on the outside. Meanwhile, both Mantia and Lee’s compatriot Jeong Jae-Won tried to overtake from the inside.
Swings crossed the line for the first Belgian gold medal at the Olympic Winter Games since 1948, when Micheline Lannoy and Pierre Baugniet won the figure skating pairs event. Only 0.07 seconds behind him, Jeong emerged second based on the photo finish. The difference between third and fourth was even smaller, with just 0.002 separating Lee’s bronze from Mantia’s fourth place.

He led the qualifying and took the lead in the final on the first dive and was never headed as he won the gold medal. He had the highest score in the final on 8 of the 11 dives, and for his 22 dives (qualifying and final), he had only two judges’ marks of 6.5, with all marks ranging from 7.0 to 9.5.
Louganis did not win a medal, but on his fourth qualifying dive, became the Nadia Comaneči of diving when he was awarded a 10.0 from judge #3, the first perfect score ever given in Olympic diving. In the final he was in third place after nine dives before stumbling on his 3½ sommie to drop back to sixth. He would come back to win this event, and the platform, in 1984 and 1988.
The silver went to Italy’s Franco Cagnotto, repeating his finish from München. Cagnotto’s teammate, platform superstar Klaus Dibiasi was considered a challenger, having placed second to Boggs at the 1973 and 1975 Worlds, but he was hampered by a sore Achilles’ tendon and placed last in the finals.

Great Britain had won gold at Rio in 2016 with a crew of Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark, and they had also been second at London in 2012. Clark had retired but Mills was back, now joined by Eilidh McIntyre, whose father, Mike McIntyre, had won gold in the Star class at Seoul in 1988. Mills and McIntyre had won the World Championships in 2019 and were silver medallists in 2017.
Other recent World Champions were Spain’s Silvia Mas and Patricia Cantero (2020); Poland’s Agnieszka Skrzypulec and Irmina Mrózek-Gliszczyńska (2017); and Japan’s hometown favorites of Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (2018). Poland was present at Tokyo but with Skrzypulec racing alongside Jolanta Ogar, who replaced Mrózek-Gliszczyńska, but who had sailed at London in 2012 with Skrzypulec.
Poland won the first two races and moved into the lead but Britain took race four to move up to second. Poland won race six and Mills/McIntyre won race seven and the two were virtually tied at that point. The Brits moved into the lead after race eight, and Poland dropped back to third going into the medal race, as they struggled in races nine and ten, and France’s Camille Lecointre and Aloïse Retornaz took over second.
None of the leaders featured in the medal race as Poland finished fourth, Great Britain fifth, and France sixth, but this was enough for Poland to leapfrog the French crew and move back up to the silver medal. France protested the medal race finish, claiming that Great Britain deliberately went wide around the last mark to allow Israel and Poland to move ahead of the French boat, but the protest was not upheld.
Great Britain’s gold medal meant the third medal in the event for Hannah Mills, who defended her Rio gold, after having won silver at London. In the silver medal position Retornaz was an Olympic debutante, but Lecointre repeated her bronze medal in this event from Rio, then racing with Hélène Defrance.

But as the summer wore on, his form went off a little. Rather than riding in the hilly country outside of Athens, the race was contested in the city, and the relatively flat course was not difficult enough to break apart the professional peleton. Into the last lap, 40 riders remained together, but a foursome of Paolo Bettini (ITA), Sérgio Paulinho (POR), Axel Merckx (BEL), and Erik Zabel (GER) got away together. On reputation, Zabel was the most highly considered, especially as a sprinter, but Bettini and Paulinho got away to win gold and silver. Merckx, the son of Eddy Merckx, chased their break, but did not catch it, but managed to stay away to win the bronze, with Zabel winning the field sprint. Bettini was a solid professional rider. He had won several classics from 2000-2004, and a stage in the Tour de France in 2000, and he would win the World Championships road race in 2006-07.

Best three scores to count for the team total. Team/individual competitions held concurrently.,na,"The format of three-day eventing was changed in 2004 with the abolition of the first three phases of the cross-country section. The two “roads and tracks” sections and steeplechase phase were discarded and the main cross-country section was shortened in length although the number of jumping efforts remained constant.
The United States arrived in Athina as reigning world champions, Great Britain were European champions and Germany, France and Australia also had high expectations. The two days of dressage produced a minor surprise with Germany, who had been expected to gain a lead, back in third place. Great Britain and France led the way although only a single penalty covered the first three teams.
The cross-country phase was unusually short of drama, not one member of the four leading nations incurred a jumping penalty and the ability of the French team to keep inside the time limit meant they took the lead. Germany moved into second with the British, Americans and Australians vying for third. The veterinary inspection before the final show jumping consolidated the French lead when a scoring member of each of the German, British and Australian teams were not passed as fit to compete.
The French had a disappointing show jumping phase and the steady performances of the Germans gave them an unassailable lead before the final French rider entered the arena. The final French rider, Nicolas Touzaint, only knocked down one fence for four penalties, a performance that became more important as events unfolded.
For the first time in Olympic history, a second round of show jumping would be used to decide the individual competition but before this could be held the results of the team competition were to be changed and then changed back again. The controversy concerned the German rider Bettina Hoy, television pictures revealed she had crossed the start line, triggering the electronic timing, and then turned full circle and crossed the start line again. After her clear round she had appeared to have helped Germany win the title but the FEI Grand Jury had noticed the infringement and added a further 14 time penalties to the score.
A meeting of the Jury of Appeal was convened after a German protest and “In the interests of fairness” Hoy’s score was returned to its’ original mark. The judge in charge of the timing had, against the rules, re-set the primary timer to zero when the rider passed the starting beam on the second occasion. An FEI spokesman said that “The change of the result is due to a wrong start procedure, which has been confirmed by the jury.” Hoy went on to win a second gold in the individual competition later the same evening.
The French, British and US teams immediately launched an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) concerning the results. On the 20th of August the CAS released their decision; The CAS said the judges’ decision should not have been reversed by the FEI because the body had no right to do so. The Jury of Appeal had only the right to make decisions regarding the interpretation of rules and the CAS said it decided that the judges’ decision to impose a time penalty on Hoy “was of a purely factual nature, falling within its exclusive jurisdiction.” The extra time penalties demoted Germany to fourth position leaving France to take gold ahead of Great Britain and the USA. Bettina Hoy was also demoted from first to ninth in the individual event.

The two greatest heavyweights in the 1980s and early 90s were American Bruce Baumgartner and Soviet Georgian Davit Gobejishvili. With Gobejishvili boycotted out of the 1984 Olympics, Baumgartner had an easier time winning gold. Gobejishvili had won the 1985 Worlds, while Baumgartner pushed him back to silver in 1986. Gobejishvili briefly lost his first spot as Soviet super-heavyweight to Aslan Khadartsev, the 1987 World and 1988-89 European Champion. At the 1988 World Cup Gobejishvili met Baumgartner and defeated him, which caused Soviet wrestling officials to have Khadartsev and Gobejishvili meet in a no time-limit match, which Gobejishvili won in 30 minutes to qualify for the 1988 Olympics.

Since the sport had been introduced to the World Championships in 2008, Great Britain had won the title every year except for 2010 and were considered not only the favorites, but in a league all of their own. Of the three riders in London, Joanna Rowsell had been to every World Championship, except in 2011, while Dani King and Laura Trott had joined the squad in 2011. The Australians had been the only nation to take the world title away from them and, although only Josephine Tomic remained from that trio, that nation was considered the most likely challenger to Britain at the Games.
Britain proved their dominance throughout the event, setting world records in every round of competition. The United States team, consisting of Sarah Hammer, Dotsie Bausch, Jennie Reed, had unexpectedly won a silver medal in the discipline at the 2011 World Championships and continued to surprise by posting a faster time than Australia in the qualifying heats. In the semi-finals the United States caused one of the biggest upsets in the cycling tournament by edging out Australia by just over eight one-hundredths of a second and stealing their spot in the gold medal match. Bausch was perhaps the star of the American team; a former runway model, she had abused drugs and suffered from anorexia for many years before turning her life around following a suicide attempt where she walked into highway traffic in the middle of the night. She took up cycling as part of her recovery and found moderate success as a professional road racer prior to shifting focus to track cycling and boosting the Americans’ performance abroad since 2009.
In the final Reed was replaced by Lauren Tamayo, in hopes that a fresh rider would give the Americans a chance at the gold, but it was to no avail. The British women posted their third world record time in the event, a blistering 3:14.051, and won the race by nearly six seconds, an incredible margin of victory for a gold medal match in the discipline. The bronze medal match was much closer, with the Canadians denying Australia a podium position by nearly two-tenths of a second. Notably, both teams posted faster times in this round than the Americans did in the final, but Canada would still have been just shy of four seconds slower than Great Britain.
After the final, inspired by the presence of Sir Paul McCartney in the velodrome, the crowd broke out into an impromptu version of “Hey Jude” in honour of the victorious British trio,

There was an opening round about which we know nothing, followed by a semi-final with two pools of eight fencers, with the top four in each advancing to a round-robin final pool of eight. The top two places still went to French fencers, with Georges, Count de la Falaise winning 6 of 7 bouts, and Léon Thiébaut losing only two matches. Count de la Falaise also competed at the 1906 and 1908 Olympics, winning gold in 1906 in individual and team épée.

This lone appearance was due to the addition of lightweight class events in 1996 that required the elimination of other disciplines. It had begun at the World Championships in 1989 and had been won by East Germany, Romania, and Canada, the latter of whom were also the reigning Pan American champions and sent three of their four World Champions, Kirsten Barnes, Brenda Taylor, and Jessica Monroe, to Barcelona, while the fourth, Jennifer Doey dropped out due to injury and was replaced by Kay Worthington. Unified Germany and Romania sent mostly different lineups, although the former had Gabriele Mehl, a World silver (1990) and bronze (1991) medalist and the latter had Iulia Bobeică, one of the 1990 World Champions. The Americans were also in contention and were represented by two World runners-up, Shelagh Donohoe and [Cindy Eckert(), augmented by Amy Fuller and Carol Feeney.

In the final, the gap between Canada and the United States was halved, but the former were the superior crew and took the gold medal, leaving the Americans with silver. Germany, meanwhile, barely staved off a strong challenge from the Chinese squad and captured bronze by a margin of only 0.16 seconds.

It returned for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but with some caveats. The women and the men, who played baseball, would have only six teams in their tournaments, to keep the number of athletes smaller. To avoid requiring the Organizing Committee to build an extra new facility, softball was played on a baseball diamond, with the baseball pitchers’ mound strangely located between second base and the softball mound. Outfield fences were artificially moved in, which meant there was no warning track for outfielders.
The six teams in the Olympic Tournament were Japan, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Italy. They played a round-robin tournament that advanced the top two, the USA and Japan, to the gold medal game, while the 3rd- and 4th-place finishers, Mexico and Canada, played for the bronze medal.
The bronze medal game was held first on 27 July. Canada scored two runs in the second inning and added another in the fifth. Mexico chipped away with runs in the third and fifth innings but could not score in the top of the seventh, and Canada held on for the win and the bronze medal, 3-2.
The pitching match-up for the gold medal game was Japan’s Yukiko Ueno facing American Cat Osterman. Osterman had played at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics and had come out of retirement to play in Tokyo at 38-years-old. Osterman was pulled in the third inning, after loading the bases, although Ally Carda got her out of the jam in relief. She gave up runs to Japan in the fourth and fifth innings and was replaced by Monica Abbott but it was too late for the Americans, who never scored. Miu Goto relieved Ueno in the 7th inning and closed out the game for a 2-0 shut-out and a Japanese gold medal. Japan actually defended their gold medal, as they also won in 2008.

Germany’s Claudia Pechstein, winner in 2002, competed in her 6th Olympics at 41, having missed the Vancouver Games due to a controversial blood passport suspension. In November 2013, she had won the first World Cup of the season. The 2006 champion Ireen Wüst (Netherlands) had won the 2011 and 2013 world titles, and had claimed a win in this distance at the European Championships in January, beating Martina Sáblíková, the defending Olympic champion and 2012 World Champion, who had won two World Cups earlier in the season.
The first skater to approach the track record of 4:02.43 (set by Wüst at the 2013 World Championships) was home favorite, Olga Graf. A better 5,000 m skater, she had never placed better than 5th in a 3,000 m World Cup, but now recorded a strong 4:03.47 on home ice. Her race saw just a 0.76 second difference between her best and worst lap. Obviously happy with her performance, Graf enthusiastically unzipped her suit after the race, nearly causing a “wardrobe malfunction” as she wasn’t wearing a bra. Graf’s strong finish turned out to be too good for Pechstein, who lost nearly 3 seconds to Graf in the last two laps. Sáblíková got off to a faster start than Graf, and, as expected, was able to stick with her schedule. She beat Wüst’s track record, the new mark now being 4:01.95. Wüst herself was up next. Typically racing with a faster start but a slower finish, Wüst recorded the fastest opening laps, but she managed to beat Sáblíková’s laps through the 2,200 m mark, after which she only conceded about a second. This was sufficient for Wüst to reclaim her 2006 title, and earn her third Olympic gold medal in all. Graf held on for bronze, while Pechstein’s 4th place meant Germany was not on the podium on this event for the first time since 1972.

But the Finns and Norwegians slowly began to regain their former strength. In 1951 the Finns fought bravely against the Swedes in Holmenkollen, Paavo Lonkila winning and Eero Kolehmainen finishing third. Norway’s best card seemed to be the 23-year-old Hallgeir Brenden, who won his first national championships 1951 and impressed to win both the 18 km. and 30 km. at the national championship in January 1952, just before the opening of the Oslo Games.
The event was hold under excellent snow conditions, and at the halfway point the Finn Tapio Mäkelä was in the lead, 10 seconds ahead of Lonkila, Brenden and Nils Karlsson, and another 5 seconds down to Norwegian Martin Stokken, and the favorite in Nordic Combined, Heikki Hasu. Stokken, the 19th starter, took an early lead, but a few minutes later Mäkelä finished 49 seconds faster. Spurred on by an enthusiastic home crowd, Brenden finished his race with excellent speed and bettered Mäkelä’s time by 35 seconds. The home crowd then waited nervously for Lonkila and Hasu. The two Finns could not match Brenden’s finishing speed, and it ended with a close battle for the bronze medal, Lonkila finishing four seconds ahead of Hasu. The Swedes had a disappointing day. Karlsson faded to fifth place in the last part of the race, his team-mates placing seventh, ninth, and 13th, far below expectations. Brenden had secured Norway’s first cross country gold since 1928 in only his third real season as a competitive skiier.
Both Stokken and Brenden were also excellent track athletes, Stokken finishing fourth in the 10000 m at the London Games in 1948. He ended his track career after the 1952 Helsinki Olympics having won 19 national titles in long-distance and cross-country running to fully concentrate on cross-country skiing.  Brenden was the first Norwegian to break the 9-minute barrier in the 3000 metre steeplechase and was twice national champion in that event.

New Zealand’s Lisa Carrington, for example, had gradually advanced the podium in the Worlds from bronze in 2013 to silver in 2014 to gold in 2015 and had taken gold in the K-1 200 two days earlier.

In 2016, Kim became the first woman to land back-to-back 1080s in a halfpipe run and won double gold at the Youth Olympic Winter Games (slopestyle, halfpipe).
PyeongChang 2018 was American Kelly Clark’s fifth Olympic Games. At the age of 34, she was already the most decorated Olympic snowboarder ever with three career medals (one gold, two bronze) never having finished lower than fourth. The first to ever land the frontside 1080 in a competition, Clark was still one of the top women in the sport.
The rising American star in women’s halfpipe, Maddie Mastro was a consistent podium finisher all season long, winning an X-Games bronze medal. Named to the USA team for Sochi 2014, Arielle Gold injured her shoulder in practice and had to withdraw, but arrived in PyeongChang as the X-Games silver medalist.
The best of the rest included two Chinese three-time Olympians Cai Xuetong and Liu Jiayu, and Spain’s Queralt Castellet, competing at her fourth Olympic Winter Games.
The top qualifier going into the finals was Kim - a favourite with the home fans because of her South Korean parents. She wowed the crowd hitting back-to-back 1080s and had already secured gold with her first run score, but improved to win by eight-and-a-half points racking up the two highest scores in the final to become the youngest halfpipe medalist in Olympic Winter Games history.
Liu, the former world champion, earned 89.75 points in her second run of three to take the silver, winning the first medal for China at the Games. She also became the second Asian woman to win a snowboard medal at the Olympic Winter Games, after Japan’s Tomoka Takeuchi who won silver in the women’s parallel giant slalom at Sochi 2014.

They were led by Oscar Wester of Sweden, a veteran skier, but one without any major titles to his name. In an additional shocking twist, Williams, Harlaut, and Bösch were all eliminated with mediocre runs.

Balczó won the swimming, with Beck placing fourth and Németh sixth. Going into the cross-country run, Beck led, with Almada second, Németh third, Nagy fourth, and Balczó sixth. But Almada was a poor runner, and would finish 52nd in the cross-country. Beck was also not strong and would place 24th, falling back to the bronze medal, although he only missed the silver by three seconds and the gold by 15 seconds.

The piste was located between the men’s and women’s speed course within the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center. The start was at an altitude of 1,160 metres and the run ended as all other Alpine skiing events in the same finishing area. The first run started in the late afternoon with cloudy weather, with spring-like temperatures between 7 (start) and 10 (finish) degrees, while the second run was held as a night-race under floodlights with a clear sky and temperatures still between 5 and 6 degrees. The snow was a main factor in this race. A lot of salt was scattered as it was necessary to firm up the snow surface, which was softened by high temperatures. But this refroze the surface causing problems as it soon become weak again and turned into slush.
The season underway saw seven World Cup slaloms held with only Marcel Hirscher (Levi and Adelboden) and Felix Neureuther (Bormio and Kitzbühel) winning twice. The other races were won by Mario Matt (Val d’Isère), Alexis Pinturault (Wengen), and Henrik Kristoffersen, who won the last World Cup slalom prior to the Games in Schladming. The current standings saw Hirscher in the lead followed by Neureuther and Kristoffersen. Hirscher also won the slalom World title in 2013 and the slalom World Cup of the last season 2012/13. Neureuther placed second both times, but his condition was uncertain after a car accident in Germany a week earlier, which caused a whiplash injury. Also considered to be strong were Jean-Baptiste Grange (World champion in 2011) and the Swedes André Myhrer (slalom World Cup winner 2011-12) and Mattias Hargin.
Going first on the fresh snow Myhrer (SWE) set the target time of 47.15. His compatriot, Hargin, was next to go and he too set a good time of 47.45. Third skier down, Matt (AUT), was to set the fastest time of the first run in 46.70. None of the other skiers was able to better any of these times, although Stefano Gross (ITA), starting 17th, managed to equal the time of Hargin for joint third place.
The second run was, like the slalom part of the Super Combined six days earlier, set by Ivica Kostelić’s father Ante. He, not for the first time, created an unusual and controversial course. Ted Ligety called it “borderline unsportsmanlike”, but as always, Kostelić answered that the top skiers also had to be smart and they should be able to race this run. With the top 30 going in reverse order the second run produced all the drama, with the early leader being Kristoffersen (NOR), starting 1.79 seconds behind Matt in 15th place, posting a combined time of 1:42.67. This time was not challenged until Hirscher (AUT), ninth after the first run, put in a storming run of 54.14 to go into the lead with a combined time of 1:42.12. Remarkably the next four skiers, Pinturault (FRA), Neureuther (GER), Ligety (USA), and Grange (FRA) all failed to finish the course. Hargin’s second run contained mistakes and he couldn’t repeat his finish of the first run, eventually finishing down in joint seventh. Gross, for a while, threatened to get into the medals and his combined time of 1:42.72 was good enough to put him in joint third place at that stage. When Myhrer also failed to complete the course, it came down to Matt’s second run to determine the medals. His experience was to carry him through and, whilst only the sixth fastest run, came through with a combined time of 1:41.84 to take the final Alpine skiing gold medal of the Games. Adam Žampa (SVK), with a time of 53.94, skied the fastest second run but, having been 26th after the first run, was never in contention for a medal and finished sixth.
Matt, who turned 35 years of age in April 2014, became the oldest Olympic Alpine skiing champion ever, while bronze medalist Kristoffersen, only 19, became the ever youngest male Olympic Alpine skier on the podium. Matt, skiing on Blizzards, won the only Alpine skiing medal for them in Sochi, while silver was won on Atomic, and bronze on Rossignol. Finishing 43th and last in this race was French-born Yohan Gonçalves the first ever Winter Olympic competitor from Timor-Leste. Hubertus von Hohenlohe did not have the luck to finish the race when he struggled in the first run. It was only the second time he failed to finish in 15 Olympic events in six Olympic Winter Games over a period of 30 years. With his six participations he equalled the record for Alpine skiers held by Marco Büchel and became the oldest ever Alpine skiing competitor aged 55.

Saint Cyr and Hartel repeated their 1-2 finish in Stockholm, although there were some complaints on nationalism by the judges, which is not uncommon in dressage. The bronze medal went to German Liselott Linsenhoff as two women won medals in the event for the first time. Linsenhoff would compete at the Olympics again in 1968-72 and won the dressage gold medal at the 1972 Olympics.
Judging controversies affected the 1956 dressage competition as both the Swedish and German judges ranked their riders 1-2-3. The German and Sweden judges, both generals, were suspended by the FEI, and the IOC threatened to take dressage out of the Olympics. After long negotiations it was agreed that there would be no team competition in Rome in 1960, only two individual riders per country would be allowed, and three judges had to be from non-participating countries.
Saint Cyr won four gold medals in dressage in 1952-56 (individual and team both years). He competed at the Olympics from 1936-60. Hartel’s story was inspirational as she been afflicted with polio in 1944 and although she recovered somewhat, she remained paralyzed below the knees for the remainder of her life. Hartel had to be helped on and off her horse.

For the first and only time, the World Championships were held concurrently with the Olympics and the Olympic Champions also became World Champions. It was the fourth staging of the World Championships, having previously been held in Lyon (France) in 1897, Turin (Italy) 1898 and Loosduinen 1899 which, since 1923 has been a district of Den Haag (Netherlands).

Out to successfully defend his title was Switzerland’s Franz Böckli while the silver and bronze medallists from 1899, Lars Jørgen Madsen (Denmark) and Olaf Frydenlund (Norway) were also present. The three French medallists from 1898, Achille Paroche (gold), Léon Moreaux (silver) and Auguste Cavadini (bronze) were also taking part as were the 1897 gold and bronze medallists Ole Østmo (Norway) and Henrik Sillem (Netherlands). The silver medallist Frank Jullien of Switzerland was the only World Championship medallist since 1897 not to compete in Paris.

Neither the United States nor Great Britain had produced a dominant long sprinter, as the most recent AAA and AAU championships had been spread among several different runners.

In the final, it was really not close for gold, as Schooling won Singapore’s first ever gold medal, in any sport, winning in 50.39, over second place 51.14. The podium was exactly as predicted as all four of the contenders made it, but nobody saw a three-way tie for the silver occurring. Cseh, Phelps, and le Clos all tied for second. This was the first ever three-way tie for any medal in swimming. It was only the eighth three-way tie for silver in any Olympic sport, the first since the 1968 Winter Olympics in women’s 500 metre speed skating, and the first at the Summer Olympics since the 1964 men’s gymnastics all-around.

France were bronze medalists at the World Championships and, with soon to be 100 freestyle Olympic champion Alain Bernard anchoring the team, now emerged as a serious threat to the US. In the opening round, another French swimmer, Amaury Leveaux, opening with a world record of 47.76 for 100 metres, and France seemed to have a clear road to the gold.
Individual silver medalist Eamon Sullivan put Australia into the lead after the first leg, breaking Leveaux’s mark by recording a world record 47.24, but from then on it became a duel between the French and the Americans. A fine third leg from Fréd Bousquet put the French half a second ahead with 100 metres to go and left Bernard with a superb chance to clinch the victory. All this reckoned without a once-in-a-lifetime swim from American anchor Jason Lezak. Lezak would finish 0.4 of a second behind Bernard in the 100 freestyle final but here he took three quarters of a second off his French rival and guided the USA to a remarkable win in yet another world record time, also preserving Michael Phelps’s quest for eight gold medals.

Sugar Ray Leonard moved on to the professional ranks, although he had stated all during the Olympics that he would not do so until he had gone to college. He would have one of the great, and longest, professional careers of any Olympic boxer. He fought through 1991, although he returned for one bout in 1997. He won his first world title in 1979, the NABF welterweight crown, and he would eventually win world titles in five different weight classes.

He had set four world records in the event in 1974-75, but his mark was bettered at the US Trials in June 1976 by Brian Goodell, where he had out-dueled Shaw.

The surprise of the tournament was a crude but strong fighter from Chile. Ramón Tapia had little experience of fighting outside his native country and was sent to a tournament earlier in 1956 in Uruguay with the knowledge that only a tournament victory would be good enough to allow him a place of the Chilean national team. He duly won and was sent to Melbourne. Tapia knocked out his first two opponents then reached the final when Gilbert Chapron was not fit to contest his semi-final. Reality kicked in during the final and the Chilean was punished for his recklessness by being knocked out in the first round of his contest with Shatkov. This was the first time Tapia had suffered this fate.
Four years later Shatkov contested the light-heavyweight division. His dreams of a second gold medal were thwarted in his second match by a young man called Cassius Clay.

According to the Official Report, there were to be three games between the three entered teams, as follows: 14 October: France vs. Germany; 21 October: Great Britain vs. Germany; and 28 October: France vs. Great Britain. All three teams competed but the match between Germany and Great Britain on 21 October did not take place. The reason given was that the British and German teams were not able to stay in Paris for the entire 15 days that would have been required for them to play both matches.
The scoring system in 1900 was a bit different than in previous years, and also different than that used today.  At the 1900 Olympics, a try was worth 3 points, as was a penalty goal. A conversion was worth 2 points and a dropped goal was worth 4 points. This scoring system was apparently devised by Coubertin, a rugby enthusiast and referee. We are indebted to Ian Buchanan (GBR), former ISOH President, who discovered this system and the scoring in the two matches which took place.
Rugby was interesting in that it attracted the biggest crowds of any event at the 1900 Olympics. As many as 6,000 spectators watched the second match of the tournament between France and Great Britain. In addition, the first known black Olympic athlete competed in the 1900 rugby tournament. This was Constantin Henriquez, who was  of Haitian origin, and later became a doctor. A picture of him exists in the German sporting magazine from 1900, Sport im Bild.

Enke was in the second pair and she crossed the line in 41.78, another Olympic record. The third pair matched Beth Heiden, who was the 1979 World Champion, winning all four distances in the process, and Soviet skater Nataliya Petrusyova, who had recently won the 1980 Worlds, winning three of the four races, including the 500. Heiden was the sister of men’s superstar Eric Heiden, who would eventually win five gold medals in Lake Placid, and the American press was building up Beth as a possibility to also win all the women’s events. But she was not the skater Eric was, and would struggle in the 500, placing only seventh. Petruseva finished in 42.42 to move into second, behind Enke.

Several times the uncontrolled crowd was seen to scatter as an errant throw headed their way.
For Flanagan, it was the first of three consecutive Olympic titles in the event, a mark only surpassed in athletics by Al Oerter in the discus and Carl Lewis in the long jump.  Flanagan was a much titled athlete.  He won championships in Britain, the United States, and Ireland in the hammer, and the weight throw, and also placed well in the shot put and the discus at several major competitions.  Amazingly for a man of his size (5-10 [1.78 metres], 220 lbs. [100 kg.]), he finished second in both the high and long jump and the all-around at the 1895 Irish Championships.
Truxtun Hare (this is the correct spelling) was better known in America as a footballer, as he had been named several times to Walter Camp’s All-American teams.  The third American, Josiah McCracken, later became a missionary doctor in China, and started one of the first medical schools there.

With Germany’s last man Martin Schmitt to jump the calculations were that he would need a distance of around 124 m to win the gold for his team but he landed a half metre short at 123.5 m and everything would depend on his style marks.

Against Giuffrida, Abe required more than seven minutes for a Golden Score. Buchard sailed through the first three rounds with convincing victories by Ippon including a 16 seconds flash victory over Switzerland’s Fabienne Kocher.
Although dominant in the bout, Kocher later missed the first Judo medal for Switzerland in succumbing Giles, who scored two Waza-aris (half points) to take bronze. Giuffrida toppled Hungarian Reka Pupp by Seoi-nage for an Ippon after 4:31. In the first round, Pupp eliminated Majlinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, sending her home after just one match.

Brown took the lead on the opener with his 44.8, leading Trinidad & Tobago with the USA third. Pinder opened the lead further with a 43.6 second leg. On the third leg, American Tony McQuay ran the fastest split of the race, recording 43.41, giving the Americans the lead at the final exchange, as he handed the baton to Taylor. Bahamian Ramon Miller pulled up to Taylor’s shoulder at the head of the stretch, and with 50 metres left, he moved into the lead and Taylor could not match him, as the Bahamas won the gold medal, with the United States second. Trinidad & Tobago filled out the podium.
The United States was fortunate to even make the final. In the heats, Manteo Mitchell led off for the Americans and felt a pop in his leg halfway through his leg. It would turn out to be a broken fibula, but he struggled on and finished his lap in 45.9, and the last three runners brought the US home in second in the heat to qualify.

The Soviet coach loudly boasted that they would have won even if the Americans had competed and that the American withdrawal was because they were afraid of playing the Soviet team.

But Wariner failed to make the Olympic team, and Merritt pulled up in the first round in London, the victim of a bad hamstring.
This left the event wide open, but the favorite, despite Merritt and Wariner’s status, had been the Grenadan 2011 World Champion, Kirani James. Many eyes were also looking to see how well the South African Oscar Pistorius would do. Nicknamed “The Blade Runner”, the bilateral amputee ran on artificial limbs, and had won numerous titles at the Paralympics. Pistorius had made the Olympic qualifying time, although there was some controversy about his running, as some experts felt his blades gave him extra propulsion and could give him an advantage. If so, they were not enough, as he was last in semi-final two, won by James. The other semis were won by Trindadian Lalonde Gordon and Luguelín Santos of the Dominican Republic, the 2012 World Junior Champion.
The final was also notable for the presence of Belgian twins Kevin Borlée, the 2010 European Champion, and Jonathan Borlée, who had just missed a European record when he won his heat in 44.43, and the absence of the American runners. No American qualified for the final for the first time at the Olympics save for the boycott year of 1980.

The Borlées placed 5-6, with Kevin leading his brother, and Pinder faded to seventh.
This was the first ever Olympic gold medal in any sport by a Grenadian athlete. The podium was also unusual in that the three athletes all represented three different Caribbean nations, the first time this had ever happened at the Olympics. James’ time also made him the first non-American to run under 44 seconds, and at only 19 years, 11 months, he was the second youngest ever under that barrier, behind only 1988 Olympic champion Steve Lewis.

As the Rio Games approached, however, they seem to have been overtaken by Australia and then by the USA.
When the teams finally hit the track it became apparent this was to be a two horse race. Great Britain’s first ride saw them lower the world record, but the Americans were equally impressive and set the third best time ever to trail by just a fraction over a second. The next round saw the world record fall twice in consecutive heats. The Americans took a second off the record to reach the final, but the British went a tenth of a second faster again.
This set up the final to be a classic. The Americans started quickest, with Sarah Hammer leading the team out and opening an early lead of half a second as their British rivals took a while to get going partly because of their choice of enormous gears. At the 1750m mark, just short of the halfway point, the British finally overhauled their opponents and began to pull away. When the clock stopped on the British it read 4:10.236 and meant they had taken two more seconds from the world record.

Multiple Olympic champion André Lange of Germany arrived to defend his two man title on the back of a brace of victories earlier in the year whilst his teammates Thomas Florschütz and Karl Angerer had both outperformed Lange in the early part of the season and were the beneficiaries of a change in qualifying rules which allowed three crews from some of the top nations to compete instead of the traditional Olympic quota of two.
With Canadian authorities limiting the number of runs available to foreign teams to the minimum required under Olympic regulations the home crews of Pierre Lueders and Lyndon Rush, with more experience on the track than any of the other teams, were also tipped to do well. In addition Rush had tied for victory with Andre Lange at the similarly high speed Sankt-Moritz track in January.
Veteran former medallist Todd Hays of the United states, returning after an absence from the sport, surprised many by placing second in the opening race of the season but his dreams of a fourth Olympic Winter Games came to an end in his very next race. A crash at the Winterberg track in Germany resulted in a cerebral haemorrhage and his immediate retirement from the sport.
The death of luger Nodar Kumaritashvili and the inevitable scrutiny about the safety of the track resulted in a few minor modifications of the course but there were still a number of accidents during the training runs. One of these crashes left Beat Hefti with a concussion and the Swiss slider was forced to withdraw from the event.

However André Lange and Kevin Kuske, in the Germany I bobsleigh and aiming for a record 4th gold medal in the sport, finished just 0.02 seconds behind their compatriots after the first run. The Germany I and II bobsleighs then posted the fastest times of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th runs, in that order, to finish with the gold and silver medals. Taking the bronze medal were the Russia I team of Alexsandr Zubkov and Aleksey Voyevoda , who had been 5th after the first run, but then placed 3rd in each of the remaining three runs.
André Lange’s fourth successive Olympic gold again proved that his consistency of performance was unequalled. The final run of the event, his 16th in Olympic competition, was the ninth time he recorded the fastest time of the run. Only once in those sixteen performances had he placed outside the top three.
Four teams crashed out of the competition although thankfully there were no serious injuries. The fifth team to fail to finish were Italy I who were the victim of an error that saw them weigh in at below the minimum weight limit.

Spain’s José Luis Doreste finished only third in the race, but it was good enough for the gold medal when Peter Holmberg of the United States Virgin Islands finished only second. Doreste had been disqualified in the fourth race and was upset with his opponents, accusing them of trying to win “in the jury room” instead of on the water. In that race, Holmberg had gone over the starting line and the premature start dropped him to last-place points, eventually depriving him of the gold medal. Doreste’s brother, Luis Doreste, had won a gold medal in the 470 class at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Holmberg’s silver was the first Olympic medal won by the U.S. Virgin Islands.
In race five of the Finn class, Joseph Chan of Singapore, who was racing concurrently in the 470 class, went overboard and was being swept away by the currents, unable to resist much because of a back injury. He was rescued by Canada’s Finn entrant Lawrence Lemieux, who had been in second place when he saw Chan struggling in the water, but deviated from his course to rescue him. Lemieux eventually finished 11th in the class, but was awarded the points for a second place position in race five, his placement when he left for the rescue. For his actions, he was given the Pierre de Coubertin Award by the IOC.

Defending Olympic Champion Helmut Recknagel was still a major force in ski jumping, winning gold on the Large Hill and bronze on the Normal Hill in the 1962 World Championships.
Wearing start number 1, the 21-year old Norwegian Hans Olav Sørensen was in the lead with a 76 m-jump until Engan, with start number 43, made an excellent jump of 79 m and took over the lead. But then the Czechoslovakian jumper Josef Matouš surprised everybody with 80.5 m, the longest jump of the day to take over the lead. Kankkonen, jumping last of the 53 participants, missed his first jump and was a distant 29th after the first round.
In the second round, a young Norwegian, 22-year-old Torgeir Brandtzæg, who had made a poor first jump, surprised with an excellent 79 m-jump. Engan made another good jump at 78.5 m and took over the lead, since Matouš was not able to follow up his first round jump. Then Kankkonen made the best jump of the day, 80 m and with high style points, but he needed another good jump to be in contention for the gold medal. After round two Engan was in a clear lead with 224.4 points, Matouš in second 6.2, points behind and the consistent German Dieter Neuendorf in third place. Brandtzæg and Kankkonen advanced to fourth and fifth place with their good second jumps and were still among the contenders for the gold medal.
In the third round, Brandtzæg made another good jump of 78 m, improving his total points but was unable to catch Engan, who also improved after his best jump of the day, another 79 m jump with better style points than his first jump. Matouš and Neuendorf were not able to improve and stayed behind Brandtzæg. Kankkonen was the last to jump, and he needed a jump around 78 m to take the gold medal from Engan. The 24-year-old Finn, showing great competitive ability, produced a stylish 79 m-jump and could celebrate as an Olympic champion. Defending champion Recknagel made three consistent jumps and came 6th. He decided to end his sporting career after the 1964 season.

The world record was 15.2, co-held by America’s Johnny Garrells and Art Shaw.  The Americans were the top hurdlers in the world, and it is instructive to look at the winners of their recent major meets.  Forrest Smithson had won the 1907 AAU title, while in 1908, Art Shaw won that event.  At the 1908 American Olympic Trial Meets, four different hurdlers won: Smithson (Western), Garrells (Central), Shaw (IC4A), and Leonard Howe of Yale (Eastern).  Garrells had also won the IC4A crown in 1907.
This race was not run on the cinder track but on a grass track in the infield of the White City Stadium.  Fourteen heats resulted in the elimination of only 11 competitors.  In the second round, Forrest Smithson equalled the Olympic record and then set a world record of 15.0 in the final.  The four American finalists were undoubtedly the best in the field but, surprisingly, they had never raced against each other before.
A well-known photograph suggests that Smithson won the final carrying a Bible in his left hand, and this false rumor has been oft repeated.  But this was, in fact, a posed photograph taken to support Smithson’s protest against Sunday competition.  Precisely to whom this protest was directed is not clear.  The Olympic final was held on a Saturday, and Sunday competition was virtually unknown in England at the time.  Smithson was a devoutly religious man and, after winning the 1909 AAU hurdles title, he became a minister.

Although he was always up in contention, he trailed veteran Anders Holmertz in the early stages as the Swede led the Olympic final at the halfway stage for the third Games in succession. Just as at Seoul and Barcelona Holmertz faded over the second part of the race and Loader took over just prior to the 150 m mark.

Brazilian Gustavo Borges just pipped Daniel Kowalski of Australia for the silver medal.
The eighth and final qualifier for the final was Paul Palmer of Great Britain. Palmer had tied Jani Sievinen for the last qualifying place which necessitated a swim-off. Incredibly the swim-off also resulted in a tie. Sievinen withdrew from the second swim-off so Palmer progressed.

His biggest challenger was expected to be Russian Sergey Shubenkov, running for the Russian Olympic Committee team, but he tweaked his Achilles’ tendon warming up for the event and could not start.
The heats only solidified Holloway’s favorite status as he ran 13.02 to win his first-round heat, the fastest ever heat time. Two of the semi-finals were won by Jamaica’s Daniel Levy and American Devon Allen, with Holloway winning the third.
The final was run on a very hot morning and Holloway took off, leading through six hurdles. He then had two overly high clearances and was suddenly challenged by Jamaican Hansle Parchment, who was on nobody’s form chart coming into Tokyo. Holloway still led after nine hurdles, but Parchment had a perfect clearance over the final hurdle and outleaned Holloway for the gold medal, as Levy took the bronze medal.
Parchment had been the bronze medalist in 2012 at London, and won silver at the 2015 World Championships, but had few top results to speak of since that time. He was also fortunate to even make it to the final. Parchment took the wrong bus on the morning of the final and it took him to the wrong venue. He needed to take a taxi to the athletics stadium but had no money on him. An Olympic volunteer, named Tijana Kawashima, loaned him the money for the taxi ride and he made it to the stadium in time to win gold.
The next day, Parchment tracked down Kawashima, re-paid her, showed her his gold medal, and gave her a Jamaican tee-shirt. The Jamaican government also later invited Kawashima and a guest to visit Jamaica for an all-expense paid full week vacation.

Nevertheless, she was the top seed ahead of South Korea’s Oh Yeon-Ji and the woman who had followed her as World Champion, Brazil’s Beatriz Ferreira.
The story of the early stages was the elimination of Oh by the Finnish super-veteran Mira Potkonen. The Finn was the first boxer to compete at the Olympics at age 40 since 1976 and was the second oldest of all-time. She was eventually eliminated by Ferreira in the semi-finals but went home with one of Finland’s only two medals of the entire Games.
The other semi-final was a re-match from the 2018 World Championship final between Harrington and Thai Navy Lieutenant Sudaporn Seesondee. Both women fought with great caution throughout and it was with great relief that the Irish woman accepted the 3-2 split decision of the judges.
The Harrington-Ferreira final started well for the Brazilian as her aggression seemed to carry the first round but, as the fight went on, the Irish fighter began to land the showier punches and rocked her opponent on more than one occasion.
As they awaited the judges’ verdict there was still doubt as to the decision but Harrington was announced as the winner for her performance over the second half of the fight. The Dubliner matched the achievement of Michael Carruth from 1992 and Katie Taylor from 2012.

The reigning 2018 World Champion was Tomasz Bartnik and he competed in Tokyo, as did silver medallist Petar Gorša, while bronze medallist Michael McPhail did not compete. At the 2021 European Shooting Championships, held only about two months before the Games, Jon-Hermann Hegg (gold), Henrik Larsen (silver), and Yury Shcherbatsevich (bronze) won the medals and all competed in Tokyo. Of the medallists from Rio, only silver medal winner Sergey Kamensky returned for the Tokyo Games. The 2012 and 2016 gold medallist of this event, Niccolò Campriani, had already retired from competition back in March 2017. Another shooter not participating in Tokyo was the current world record holder in the qualification rounds (1,188 points) Jan Lochbihler, who did not qualify. The current world record holder for the final round was Yang Haoran with 465.3 points. He was present in Tokyo but did not compete in this event, taking part only in the two air rifle events, winning a gold and a bronze medal.
The qualification round was won by Kamensky followed by Zhang Changhong, who both had 1,183 points with Kamensky ranked first with more inner 10s. In the final Zhang led from the beginning and, after three kneeling and three prone series for a total of 30 shots, the top three – Zhang, Kamensky, and Shcherbatsevich – were separated by only 1.1 points. After the first standing series Kamensky took the lead while Shcherbatsevich slipped back to fifth place. In the next series Zhang came back to overtake Kamensky again while Shcherbatsevich was already eliminated before the single shots. The single shots did not change any of the medal positions with Zhang taking gold and winning the first individual shooting gold medal for a Chinese male at the Tokyo Games and, in doing so, setting a world record for the final round with 466.0. Kamensky won silver as he did five years earlier in Rio, and Milenko Sebić won the second shooting medal for Serbia with the bronze.

His opponent in the final, Sweden’s Ingemar Johansson, appeared to be completely intimidated by the American’s reputation and spent most of the fight backpedalling around the ring. When Sanders did get into range Johansson would simply grab hold of his opponent. Eventually an increasingly irate referee grew tired of warning the Swede and disqualified him for “not trying”. This also had the effect of denying Johansson his silver medal and the second step on the podium remained vacant.
Sanders, a member of the US Navy, turned professional in 1954 with high expectations but these were derailed when he lost only his fourth pro fight. In December 1954 he was knocked out by Willie James in a fight at the Boston Garden. Sanders was rushed to hospital with a blood clot on the brain and succumbed to his injury, dying three days later.
Ironically it was Johansson who became a household name as a professional when he became the first European to win the World Heavyweight Championship for over 20 years after knocking out fellow Olympic champion Floyd Patterson. In 1982, 30 years after his Olympic embarrassment, Johansson was finally awarded his silver medal after the IOC were persuaded to reverse their decision.

Davis had won the 2005 World Allround Championships, and in 2004 he had won the 1500 m world title as well. His 2005/2006 record in the 1,000 m was superb, making him the top favorite for the gold. He had taken part in six of nine World Cup races, and won them all (taking the rest off to try and qualify for the US Olympic short track team). In passing, Davis also bettered the world record, which dated from the 2002 Olympics and set it at 1:07.03. The only question mark was his performance at the recent World Sprint Championships, where he had “only” placed 6th and 3rd in the 1000 ms. Races there were won by two-time Olympic runner-up Jan Bos and 2001 World Champion Jeremy Wotherspoon. Other contenders were World Sprint Champion and 500 m winner Joey Cheek and 2003 and 2004 World Champion Erben Wennemars.
Davis was the first of the favorites to skate, with 5,000 m champion Chad Hedrick leading at that moment. Skating behind Wotherspoon for the first lap and a half, Davis unleashed his usual fast final lap, to finish in 1:08.89. Davis’s relatively slow start left room for Cheek and former world record holder Lee Gyu-Hyeok, as both went neck-on-neck for the first 600 m. But neither could match Davis’s closing 26.6 lap, and finished at 1:09.16 and 1:09.37. The remaining pair featured two Dutchmen, Bos and Wennemars. The two went off more conservatively, but met with the same fate as Cheek, losing time in the final lap. Eventually, Wennemars edged ahead of Bos and narrowly took the bronze medal ahead of Lee. Cheek announced he would donate his silver medal bonus ($15,000) to the “Right to Play” charity, which he had also done with his 500 m bonus.

His victory was an easy one, given that his strongest competitors – his teammates – could not compete. Heßlich had the fastest qualifying time over 200 metres and then won eight consecutive races to win the gold medal. Without the 1984 Soviet-led boycott, this would likely have been a third consecutive gold medal for Heßlich.

His main worry for the final was the possibility of collusion between his two American team-mates, the Kahanamoku brothers Duke and Sam, to impede his progress. These worries had no foundation as the Hawaiians were more interested in seeing an American sweep of the medals than in any foul play. Although Weissmuller finished well outside his own world record, his winning margin of nearly two and a half seconds has never since been approached. The American’s victory was greeted by sustained cheering by the Parisian spectators and was one of the most popular of the entire games. Weissmuller had little time to savour his victory as he was due to play in the final of the third-place tournament for the US water polo team that same afternoon.

After arriving in Finland he was persuaded by team official to shed the necessary weight and fight as a light-heavyweight. Lee impressed in training and was given the US berth in his new division.
This proved a masterstroke by the US officials as Lee proved to be the outstanding boxer in any of the weight divisions in Helsinki and was a worthy winner of the Val Barker Trophy for the best boxer at the Games. Lee was a graduate of Howard University and did not follow the usual career path for an American Olympic boxing champion and refused to turn professional. Instead he spent a lifetime working in adult education whilst also moonlighting as a judge in professional boxing.

Qualifying scores did not carry over to the final round. Previously, there were 36 finalists, with three allowed from each nation. This format had been used at the 2003 World Championships, although it had actually been used at the 1993 Worlds as well, but the format reverted to the 36/3 rule from 1995-2001. American Paul Hamm had won the all-around at the 2003 Worlds and came to Athinai as the favorite. He would eventually win the gold medal but in the most controversial men’s gymnastic event ever.
Hamm led the qualifying round, and he took an early lead in the final round. On his fourth rotation, however, the vault, Hamm missed his landing, scoring only 9.137 points and dropping to 12th place. He and his coach conferred and decided if he could score 9.8s on the final two rotations, he might be able to salvage a bronze medal. He then performed one of his best parallel bars routines ever, scoring 9.837 to move back into fourth place. The leaders after five rotations were the two Koreans, Kim Dae-Eun and Yang Tae-Yeong. Yang’s fifth rotation had been on parallel bars, on which he scored 9.712, but this would ignite the controversy.
Kim opened the final rotation on the floor exercise and scored 9.650 to remain in the lead, especially when Yang missed a grip on a pirouette on the high bar and scored only 9.475. Hamm then followed Yang on the high bar and nailed the routine, thinking he had secured the bronze medal, but when his score of 9.837 was posted, he had won the gold. At least it seemed he had.
Then the arguments began. The Koreans protested that on the parallel bars, Yang’s start value had been re-assigned as 9.9 instead of the 10.0 they felt it deserved. They approached the head judge, George Beckford, of the United States, who waved them off and discounted the complaint, stating that the start value was correct. The Korean officials then appealed to the A-panel judges, Bultrago Reyes of Colombia and Benjamin Bango of Spain. They reviewed the notes and spotted an error. Yang’s listed elements had included a Morisue (double back to upper arms) while it was actually a Belle (giant to double back to upper arms), and the difference would have increased his start value by 0.10 points, or up to the 10.0 the Koreans were claiming.
The Koreans claimed that Yang should be given the gold medal but the Americans also noted that Yang had made a mistake on his parallel bars routine, performing 4 hangs, although only 3 were allowed, and he had not been penalized for this. Had this error been noted, he would have had a 0.2 penalty and would have had a lower total score, even if the start value were corrected.
The Korean Olympic Committee disregarded this argument, stating that other gymnasts were not penalized for this, and then protested to the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), which refused to hear it, stating that it was after the competition, and noting that their rules required all protests to be filed during the competition. Two days later the FIG Executive Committee reviewed the case and released a statement noting that Yang’s start value should have been 10.0, but did not change the results, although they suspended the three judges responsible.
Bruno Grandi, FIG President, then wrote a letter to Paul Hamm, sending it via the US Olympic Committee, in which Grandi urged Hamm to return the gold medal and give it to Yang. Grandi wrote, “I wish to remind you that the FIG Executive Committee has admitted the error of judgement made on the Parallel Bars and suspended the three responsible judges, two from the A panel and the FIG Technical Committee member. Indeed, the start value of the Korean gymnast Yang Tae Young was given as 9.9 instead of 10. As a result, the true winner of the All-Around competition is Yang Tae Young. If, (according to your declarations to the press), you would return your medal to the Korean if the FIG requested it, then such an action would be recognised as the ultimate demonstration of Fairplay by the whole world. The FIG and the IOC would highly appreciate the magnitude of this gesture. At this moment in time, you are the only one who can make this decision.”
The US Olympic Committee was not pleased with this letter from Grandi and refused to forward it to Hamm. Their response to Grandi included the following, “Your letter states ‘the IOC would highly appreciate the magnitude of this gesture.’ You should know that upon receipt of your letter, we immediately contacted the International Olympic Committee and its President, Dr. Jacques Rogge, which expressed its displeasure over the fact the FIG would even consider placing an athlete in such an untenable position and strongly stated they do not support the letter or its contents. Mr. Grandi, it is important to remind you that your own Federation rules, and your own public statements, clearly indicate that Mr. Hamm is the Olympic gold medalist in the 2004 Individual Men’s All-Around. We share and support that viewpoint. The statement in your letter that ‘the true winner of the All-Around competition is Yang Tae Young’ is not only inconsistent with your rules and public statements, it is incorrect and undermines the very spirit of the Olympic Games. As stewards of the Olympic movement, we all share a responsibility to protect, and not sacrifice, the interests of athletes. We encourage you and other individuals within FIG, who saw this as an appropriate remedy, to begin taking that responsibility more seriously. Once again, we urge you to immediately retract this unacceptable request.”
The Korean officials and Yang were not yet done. They then appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). A hearing was held in Lausanne, Switzerland on 27 September 2004 at which Hamm and the US Olympic Committee appeared. On 21 October the CAS announced their decision which supported Hamm, allowing him to keep the gold medal. The ruling noted, “An error identified with the benefit of hindsight, whether admitted or not, cannot be a ground for reversing a result of a competition…. However, quite apart from the consideration that no one can be certain how the competition in question would have turned out had the official’s decision been different, for a Court to change the result would on this basis still involve interfering with a field of play decision. Each sport may have within it a mechanism for utilizing modern technology to ensure a correct decision is made in the first place (e.g. cricket with run-outs) or for immediately subjecting a controversial decision to a process of review (e.g. gymnastics) but the solution for error, either way, lies within the framework of the sport’s own rules.” They also noted that the Korean protest was not made before the end of the competition, as required by FIG rules.
So the final result was 1) Paul Hamm (USA); 2) Kim Dae-Eun (KOR); 3) Yang Tae-Young (KOR). Pretty simple, eh?

In the final Hall led on the butterfly opener, his best stroke, trailed by Hungary’s András Hargitay, but he was almost three bodylengths behind. On the backstroke, Hall opened up further, leaving Hargitay a full three bodylengths in arrears, with Larsson half-a-lap behind, but Larsson’s best stroke was the breaststroke and it was Hall’s worst. Hall was tiring and American Tim McKee caught him at 275 metres, moving into the lead. Hall still led Larsson after 300 metres but he was visibly tiring and Larsson moved ahead of both McKee and Hall at 325 metres. The final was too close to call so the fans looked to the electric timing. Both Larsson and McKee had finished in 4:31.98, a seeming tie.
But the electric timer could measure to the 1/1000ths of a second and when that was done, Larsson had the gold medal – 4:31.981 to 4:31.983. Thousandth second timing was used at the 1973 World Championships, but this would not be allowed again, as it was shown that this was less than the thickness of one coat of paint on the wall, and minute differences in the lanes could affect this result. All future international swimming races after 1973 would be decided only to the 1/100th of a second, and if swimmers were tied at that margin, they were declared tied.

The winner of the race was the French “Femur” with Henri Gilardoni at the helm. Émile Michelet, helmsman on the “Turquoise,” also competed successfully in the ½-1 Ton Class.

Katie Taylor of Ireland, the outstanding woman boxer of recent years, would overwhelm all her opponents with ease as she bathed in the applause of a vast green clad army of supporters who had followed her across the Irish Sea. And that, more or less, is what happened…
When Taylor stepped into the ring for the gold medal decider against old rival Sofya Ochigava of Russia most of Ireland came to a standstill. 10,000 people gathered to watch on a giant screen in her town of Bray (population 8,000) and inside the Olympic arena the crowd noise soared to an estimated 120 decibels. In truth Taylor’s performance was not one of her best but she rallied after a shaky start to overhaul Ochigava’s early lead and then withstand the Russian’s final onslaught to win by a 10-8 margin. She became the first Irish Olympic boxing champion since 1992 and only the second Irish woman, following the controversial swimmer Michelle Smith, to win Olympic gold.

In five meetings from 2005-2007, Felix had defeated Campbell-Brown every time with comfortable margins, but Campbell-Brown had slightly the better of 2008 performances, and there was little to choose between them. These two won their semi-finals, setting the stage for the confrontation in the final. Campbell-Brown was drawn in lane four, just inside Felix. On the curve she closed the stagger on Felix, and had 2/10ths of a second on her at 100 metres, Felix only in fourth place at that point. Felix closed quickly on the field, but could not make up any ground on Campbell-Brown who maintained her margin to win the gold medal, Felix in second. Jamaica added a second medal when Kerron Stewart added bronze to the silver she had won in the 100. Bahraini runner Rakia Al-Gassra made it to the semis, a remarkable performance considering she ran fully covered up, in accordance with Muslim customs.

The South American “Las Leonas” had claimed the 2010 world title on their home pitch in Rosario, beating the Dutch in the final. They had also claimed the Champions Trophy in 2009, 2010 and 2012. After silver in 2000 and bronze in 2004 and 2008, the Argentineans were now aiming for Olympic gold. Star player Lucha Aymar, known as the )Maradona of hockey), was the country’s flagbearer, signifiying their expectations. It’s noteworthy that the team failed to qualify from the Americas via the Pan American Games, losing to the United States in the final. But as South Africa withdrew its direct qualification, Argentina was granted a spot on account of their #1 world ranking, thus avoiding having to play a qualification tournament. The Dutch were eager to retain their Beijing title. Since 2008, they had lost some of their veteran players, and had switched to an Argentine coach, Max Caldas. They had beaten Argentina in the 2011 Champions Trophy (after penalty strokes), and won the European title that same year. Much was also expected from the British women, who had made the final of the 2012 Champions Trophy, as well as traditional top nations Germany and Australia.
The Dutch team, who lost key defender Willemijn Bos to injury in the last practice match before the Olympics, won all of their pool A matches, albeit four of them with only one goal difference. The British also qualified for the semis, despite a loss to 2008 finalist China, which missed out on qualification due to disappointing results against débutants Belgium and Japan. In the other pool, things were very close. Argentina, New Zealand and Australia all had three wins and one loss, with Argentina having the best goal difference. After New Zealand drew with Germany in the morning, Australia needed to beat Argentina to win, but Las Leonas kept it to 0-0 to advance. For New Zealand, it was the first time their team reached the Olympic semi-finals - in 2008, they had finished last.
The semi-finals were closely contested affairs: New Zealand and the Netherlands drew 2-2 and duked it out in the penalty shoot-out. Dutch goalie Joyce Sombroek provided three saves to help her team advance to their third consecutive final. Argentina had taken a comfortable 2-0 lead, but had to fight off the British for the last five minutes after Alex Danson scored. In the anticipated final, penalty corners proved decisive. The first goal was somewhat controversial, as an earlier Dutch foul had been missed by the referees, but Carlien Dirkse van den Heuvel’s rebound goal counted. A few minutes later, penalty corner specialist Maartje Paumen put away the second goal, to earn the Dutch their third women’s hockey title, the same number of titles as Australia. Of note, four members of the Dutch team were openly gay, the highest known number of any Olympic team: Paumen, Dirkse van den Heuvel, Kim Lammers and Marilyn Agliotti. The first two were even in a relationship together for some years, but this ended shortly after the Olympics.

These three lived up to their expectations and were joined in the semi-final by Ortíz of Mexico.
Sergo was a factory worker but had received generous backing by the Federazione Pugilistica Italiana and was in excellent physical condition. Sergo defeated Cederberg and moved on to the final where he would meet Wilson for the gold medal. Although Wilson, at 5 ft 10 in/182 cm,  was the taller man and had a reach advantage over his opponent, the tenacious Italian took the fight to the American. The first round was close but Sergo moved up a gear from then on, forcing his opponent back onto the ropes and negating his physical advantages. Wilson had been considered the USA’s best chance of a championship but when he tried to turn the fight his way in the final round he had left it too late, Sergo was a clear champion.
Sergo went on to win the European Amateur championships on home soil in 1937 and retain it in 1939 in Dublin. He would have been a strong medal contender for the cancelled 1940 Games. With no prospect of further Olympic success available, Sergo turned professional but no less than six attempts at Italian national titles ended in failure. Jackie Wilson’s professional début came in late 1936 in Los Angeles, where he was to base his career. One of the best lightweights and welterweights of his era, he was unlucky never to earn a world title shot.

Italy, which had been runner-up at the 1991 Worlds, and would repeat that finish in 1993, won the bronze medal. Smetanina’s gold medal made her the first Winter Olympian to win 10 medals, and this also made her the first woman to win medals at five Olympic Winter Games.

That put Artur Aleksanyan of Armenia, the 2012 Olympic bronze medalist, two-time World champion (2014, 2015) and three-time European champion (2012, 2013, 2014) as the favourite. With two other World champions in the field, including twice World champion Cenk İldem and 2011 champion Elis Guri of Bulgaria, anything could happen.
But it was the 2015 Pan American Games gold medalist, Yasmany Lugo of Cuba, who Aleksanyan beat 3-0 to win the heavyweight title, and Armenia’s first gold medal at the Rio 2016 Games (and their second all-time since independence in 1991). He is now the first Armenian athlete in any sport to win multiple Olympic medals.
Aleksanyan did not give up a single point in his final three bouts from the quarter-finals onward and won back-to-back matches by technical fall in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, beating world number six Turkey’s Cenk İldem in the semi-finals. Ildem went on to win the first bronze after winning his medal match with Romania’s Alin Alexuc-Ciurariu by a score of 4-0.
The other bronze medal was won by the 2012 Olympic champion, Iran’s Ghasem Rezaei, who trailed Sweden’s Carl Schön 4-0 at the end of the first period. When the wrestlers went into par-terre in the second period, Rezaei was able to turn Schoen twice to tie the match and take the advantage on criteria. 
Nicknamed the “White Bear” Aleksanyan is one of the most renowned Armenian athletes of the 21st century. During the medal ceremony, he wore a shirt with an image of Robert Abajyan—a junior sergeant killed in Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabagh/NKR) who posthumously received the “Hero of Artsakh” award in April 2016 at the age of 19.

Although they sent a new lineup consisting of Bernhard Knubel, Heinz Renneberg, and 13 year-old Klaus Zerta, they were still considered the favorites for the event at the 1960 Summer Olympics. Indeed, this trio saw little in the way of challenge during the tournament, winning their heat with ease and finishing safely ahead of Antanas Bagdonavičius, Zigmas Jukna, and Igor Rudakov of the USSR in the final. This victory also earned Zerta a distinction as the youngest medalist of any kind at the Games. The Soviets earned silver by finishing well before the Americans, who in turn captured the bronze medal a good distance ahead of Denmark.

Furthermore, the event had been won at the last two Olympics by Pertti Karppinen of Finland, who was the favorite to defend his crown for a third time in Los Angeles. Unlike in 1980, however, he would not go unchallenged, as he would face West Germany’s Peter-Michael Kolbe, the 1976 Olympic runner-up and a four-time World Champion. The threat from Argentina’s Ricardo Ibarra, three-time Pan-American champion and winner of the 1980 Diamond Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta, could not be ignored either.
The opening round was dominated by Karppinen, who finished over three seconds ahead of the other heat winner, Robert Mills of Canada, and over seven and a half seconds faster than Kolbe, the runner-up in the Finn’s heat. Mills was new to the international scene, having made his début at the 1983 Pan American Games, but he had already gold medals in the double and quadruple sculls. He was not usually a single sculler, but attempted to qualify for Canada in that event after tensions rose concerning his placement on the quadruple sculls crew. Karppinen and Mills faced each other in the semi-finals and the Canadian forced the Finn into his smallest margin of victory of the last two Olympics. In the other semi-final heat, meanwhile, Kolbe barely scraped by with a victory over Ibarra. In the final, however, Kolbe, and especially Karppinen, were untouchable. Finland won gold with room to breathe while West Germany took silver over eight seconds ahead of bronze medalist Mills. Karppinen therefore became the second single sculler, after Vyacheslav Ivanov of the Soviet Union, to win the event at three consecutive Olympics.

In the Barcelona final, Barrowman again broke his world record, finishing in 2:10.16 to win gold, as he was in control from start-to-finish and won comfortably. He was followed by Hungarian Norbert Rózsa, also second in the 100 breast in Barcelona, and Britain’s Nick Gillingham, as the podium was exactly as it had been at the 1991 Worlds.

The short-distance race for men had previously been 15 kilometres, or 18 kilometres through 1952, but in 1992 it was changed to 10 km. The event had been won at the last two World Championships by Terje Langli (1991) and Sture Sivertsen (1993) but the favorites in the event were Bjørn Dæhlie and Vladimir Smirnov. Dæhlie had won the last two seasonal World Cups, and was fighting with Smirnov in the 1993-94 season, which would be won Smirnov, who had also won in 1990-91.

Smirnov started slowly, trailing the pace of Marco Albarello but had moved to second at the second checkpoint.
Albarello hung on for the bronze medal. He had won two silvers in Albertville and would add a gold in the relay in Lillehammer. Smirnov was in his third Winter Olympics, representing his third country, after the Soviet Union in 1988 and the Unified Team in 1992, he was now skiing for Kazakhstan.

And he did not, winning the 200 IM, although it was somewhat closer than expected. Darnyi won in 2:00.76, only 0.21 seconds ahead of American Greg Burgess. Darnyi was only fourth after three legs, and the curse appeared real, but he powered home to defend his gold medal.
American Ron Karnaugh finished sixth in the final, which was a difficult swim for him emotionally. His father, Peter, came to the Opening Ceremony, and then died of a heart attack after leaving the stadium. Ron Karnaugh did not know this until later that night when USOC Executive Director Harvey Schiller and USOC Board member George Steinbrenner came to his room in the Olympic Village to tell him. Steinbrenner, well-known as the owner of the New York Yankees, learned that his mother was concerned about how they would pay for Ron’s medical school, which he planned to start that fall, but Steinbrenner told them not to worry, and financed the schooling of the man he would later call “Doctor Ron.” Karnaugh later became a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation.

The Swedish boat could not hold the place and “Dormy” took a comfortable lead in a light breeze. With more wind on the second round, the Belgian boat “Zut” made the best time to move into overall third.
On the second day, again “Sibindi” had the best start and was leading over the major part of the first round. But at the end of the first circuit, it was a dead-heat for the French boat and “Dormy.” “Sibindi” took the lead again but was finally outsailed by “Dormy” and “Guyoni.” “Dormy” succeeded again, this time just 32 seconds ahead of the French “Guyoni”.
On the third day, “Sibindi” took an early lead again. Then “Zut” took the lead, holding on to it until the finish line, winning the third race with “Guyoni” again coming in second.

This made them the fifth nation, after Australia, Germany, Japan and the United States, to have a medal sweep in an Olympic men’s event. Because of the changes in Olympic rules, which beginning in 1984 limited nations to only two swimmers per individual event, this is also the last men’s swimming to have seen one nation sweep the medals.

She made that, turning 14-years-old only 20 days after the Olympic platform final. Fu was unchallenged in Barcelona, winning both the qualifying and final rounds by huge margins. She was helped by her optional dives, all of which had a degree of difficulty of 3.0 or higher, with two at 3.2 and one at 3.3. She clinched the title on her penultimate dive, a back 3½ tuck (3.3), scoring 8s and 8.5s to move well ahead of her teammate, Zhu Jinhong. But on the final dive, Zhu missed badly on an inward 3½ tuck, dropping out of the medals, which went to Yelena Miroshina (EUN-silver) and Mary Ellen Clark (USA-bronze).
Clark was the second-oldest competitor in the event and was second after six dives, but then blew an inward 3½ tuck. She would return in 1996 to repeat her bronze medal performance, overcoming difficulty with vertigo. Fu would return to Atlanta and win both diving events, adding a fourth gold medal in the 2000 springboard, and a silver in synchronized springboard.

Silver medalist Miroshina never competed internationally after Barcelona. On 18 December 1995 she died after a fall out of her ninth-floor apartment in Moscow, at only 21-years-old. The details are murky, as it is uncertain if this was a suicide or she fell or was pushed.

In addition, she had won two more titles with the Chinese squad at the World Team Championships. In November 2008, Wang had also set the world record for this event, at 42.609.

There was no opening ceremony of the Olympics held prior to the game - that was to come later. This was the first time ice hockey was conducted at the Olympic Games and it has been held continuously since; however, at the Olympic Winter Games only.
This was also the only time that Olympic ice hockey was contested by seven-man teams. The seventh position was that of rover, in addition to three forwards, two defensemen, and the goalie. The tournament was conducted indoors at Le Palais de Glace d’Anvers, situated at the Rue de la Santé, near the Botanic Gardens in Antwerp. The rink measured only 18×56 metres (59 by 185 feet), which was quite narrow by Canadian standards and was made to appear even smaller by the 14 skaters on the ice. Finally, the games consisted of two 20-minute halves, unlike the Canadian game of three 20-minute periods.
Canada, where ice hockey is the national game, was the class of the tournament, being challenged only by the United States team. The Winnipeg Falcons, who had won the 1920 Allan Cup, symbolic of amateur hockey supremacy in Canada, represented Canada. The Falcons were formed as a team in 1908, joining two previous teams, the Viking and Athletic Clubs of Winnipeg. They disbanded after one year, but reorganized in 1912. Although the team suspended play during the war, the Falcons resumed competition in 1919, winning the championship of Western Canada. They won the Allan Cup in 1920 by defeating the University of Toronto Varsities, 8-3 and 3-2. Of the eight “Canadian” players, seven were actually of Icelandic origin. Only goalie Wally Byron was not. The team nickname, Falcons, was chosen because the Falcon is a symbol of Iceland.
The United States was represented by 11 players who were members of three clubs – the St. Paul Athletic Club, the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, and the Boston Athletic Association. At least four members of the American team were born and raised in Canada – the brothers Joe and Larry McCormick, Frank Synnott, and Herbert Drury. They had been playing for American clubs for some time and, although they were all Canadian citizens, it is not known if they had also attained American citizenship by 1920. It mattered little for Olympic eligibility rules were much more lax in that era. In a training match on 23 March, the U.S. team played the Winnipeg Falcons, losing 3-2 to the Canadians.
In the first game, Sweden against Belgium, it was noted by one sportswriter that “the Swedes were rough even by Canadian standards.” The next day, Canada and the U.S. made their débuts, winning easily. In the Canadian 15-0 victory over Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovakia did not get a single shot on goal.
In the semi-finals, Sweden defeated France 4-0. The big match was the other semi-final between the United States and Canada. The referee was to be Garon, a Canadian who was an officer with the American Red Cross. The Canadians demanded the right to replace him if his work was unsatisfactory and he refused to referee under that condition, being replaced by M. Catella, a Frenchman. The game was scoreless at halftime, but Canada scored two second-half goals to win 2-0. In the finals, Canada defeated Sweden quite easily, 12-1.
Second- and third-place were decided by the Bergvall System (termed the Vancouver System in Canada) in which all teams losing to the champion, Canada, played off in a single-elimination tournament to decide the runner-up. When that was finished, all teams that had lost to either the first or second-place team then contested another single-elimination tournament for third place. The United States easily defeated Czechoslovakia, 16-0, for second place, while Czechoslovakia nipped Sweden 1-0, to earn the bronze medal. Sweden was decidedly hampered by the draw of the Bergvall system, being forced to play games on five consecutive days.

The high jump was contested on 10 April. The opening height was 1.50 metres, and all jumpers were required to jump at each height.

She had already won the platform in Atlanta, so she needed this for the double. Her biggest challenge was expected to come from her teammate, Tan Shuping, the 1994 World Champion. But Tan almost belly-flopped her third dive in qualifying, and when her last dive was also done poorly, she had placed 23rd and did not even make the semis.
Russian Vera Ilyina led the qualifiers and after the semi-finals, with Fu only in fourth place. But Fu’s DD on her final dives enabled her to move ahead and win the diving double. Ilyina dove terribly in the final round, with only the 10th best final round scores, dropping down to seventh place overall. The silver medal went to Irina Lashko, which she had also won in 1992. The bronze medal went to Canada’s Annie Pelletier, who was third in the event at the 1994 Worlds, won both springboards (1- and 3-metre) at the 1994 Commonwealth Games, and won the springboard at the 1995 Pan American Games. This shutout the Americans from the podium for the second consecutive Olympics, after they had dominated the sport through 1984.
Lashko was good at finishing second in major internationals on springboard. She did so at the 1990 Goodwill Games, the 1991 World Championships, the 1992 and 1996 Olympics and the 1987, 1989, and 1993World Cups. She could be excused slightly in Atlanta, however, as she only returned to diving in 1995 after giving birth to a daughter in 1994.

In the final, Germany was led out by Jens Fiedler, the 2004 sprint, keirin, and team sprint World Champion, and gave them the lead. Japan could never overcome that and had to settle for the silver medal, which was still considered a surprise as they had never medaled in this event at the Worlds. In the bronze medal race, France defeated Australia by a narrow margin. In addition to Fiedler, Germany had a very strong team as René Wolff won the bronze in the sprint, and Stefan Nimke had won two pursuit medals at the Olympics.

The most prominent was probably Oleksandr Shaparenko of the Soviet Union, who, among his many international accolades, was the reigning World and final European champion (the tournament was discontinued after 1969) and 1968 Olympic runner-up. Also present were Sweden’s Rolf Peterson and Denmark’s Erik Hansen, the 1960 and 1964 Olympic champions respectively (Hansen was also the 1968 bronze medalist).

The opening heats were won by Shaparenko, Ladislav Souček of Czechoslovakia, and Jean-Pierre Burny of Belgium, while Hansen only survived to the next round after going through the repêchage. The Dane made up for this in the semi-finals, however, by setting an Olympic record, while the other heats were won by Csapó and Shaparenko. The final developed into a dash towards the finish line between Peterson and Shaparenko, which the latter won in Olympic record time, albeit by a margin of only 0.29 seconds, to claim gold. Peterson settled for silver while Csapó came in just over a second latter to take bronze. Hansen, meanwhile, struggled in the medal round and finished seventh in his fourth and final Olympics.

Host nation West Germany was to take the gold in a controversial final against Pakistan. The two teams had already met in the preliminary round, with the Germans beating the winners of the inaugural World Championships (held in 1971). Determined to retain their Olympic title, the Pakistani locked down the match. After thirty minutes, they appeared to take the lead, but their goal was disallowed for offside, which was heavily disputed by Pakistan. With only ten minutes on the clock, a penalty corner was awarded to West Germany after a hard foul. Germany’s Peter Trump lost his cool when some of his opponents tried to prevent him from taking the corner. This resulted in Trump being sent off for five minutes. When the shot was finally taken, it was perfectly pushed behind goalie Salim Sherwani by Michael Krause.
Now trailing with few minutes left, the Pakistani players and supporters started to misbehave. The match had to be stopped twice because of onlookers on the pitch, and the players kept on complaining to the referee, even after the final whistle. At the victory ceremony, the Pakistani handled their silver medals with contempt, and refused to face the West German flag when it was raised in honour of the victors. Furthermore, they threatened the doctor that wanted to perform doping tests. This prompted the IOC to exclude all players from the Olympics and ban all eleven players from ever competing in the Olympics. This decision was perceived as harsh in Pakistan, as the US basketball team had refused to accept their silver medals after their controversial final. They had not been banned, although two American 400 meter runners (Matthews and Collett) had been. After a formal apology by the Pakistan Hockey Federation, bans for all but three players were dropped, and eventually all players were cleared in time to compete in Montreal.

Seven days later he toed the line for the 5K final, an event he had won at the 2011 World Championships, with all Britain looking for a distance double gold. His biggest challengers were actually expected to be two Americans – Bernard Lagat, World Champion in the 1,500 and 5,000 at the 2007 World Championships; and Galen Rupp, Farah’s training partner, who had trailed behind him while winning silver in the 10K.
The final turned into a slow, tactical race, setting it up for the kickers, especially Lagat. Fully 10 of the 15 finalists came to the bell lap together, as Farah had taken the lead with 700 to go, with Rupp joining in with 600 left. But the pack passed Rupp and came after Farah, as several runners made attempts to go by him. But no one succeeded, Farah coming home in a final lap 52.9, and final straight of 13.1 to win his second gold medal. The silver went to Ethiopian Dejen Gebremeskel, who also ran 52.9 on the final lap, but could never get past Farah’s shoulder. Kenyan Thomas Longosiwa was next to them at the head of the straight but could not match their finish, taking bronze, just ahead of Lagat in fourth. Rupp did not have the kick he needed and placed seventh.
The British-mad Olympic Stadium exploded on the final lap, with Track & Field News noting that the sound reached 140 decibels, jet takeoff levels, and it rocked the stadium enough to shake the finish camera and make the final pictures too blurry, requiring use of the back-up infield camera.

Double Olympic champion Claressa Shields had graduated to the professional ranks and already established herself as the supreme force in that version of the sport. This prompted Christina Hammer, the German whose 10-year reign as professional world champion Shields had ended, to make the opposite journey and attempt a late career switch to “amateur” boxing. Sadly, the cancellation of the final global qualifier ended Hammer’s dreams before they could begin to take shape.
Since 2016 two women had emerged as the best middleweights in the world. Nouchka Fontijn of the Netherlands had twice been European champion, a regular medallist at World Championship level and silver medallist behind Shields in Rio, while Lauren Price of Great Britain had pushed the Dutchwoman in a number of championships before 2019. In 2019 Price beat Fontijn in the final of the European Games before the two staged a memorable battle later in the year at the World Championship. Fontijn was originally awarded the fight but after an appeal, the bout review jury controversially decided to re-score it in favour of Price. In Tokyo, the two were seeded to meet in the semi-finals.
To no one’s surprise Price-Fontijn turned out to be another closely fought bout. Fontijn started well and, after Price was deducted a point for holding in round two, it appeared that the Dutch boxer was going to extract her revenge for the world final. Price rallied to take the second round and the deciding third to win by the slim margin of 3-2 from the judges.
In the final, Price would meet her predecessor at World Champion, the tall Chinese fighter Li Qian. Li had won world title in 2018 but then had not been selected for the 2019 Worlds. From the start Price used her speed and agility to great effect, jabbing away and then moving out of distance of any counter punching. She took the first two rounds then landed some punches as the fight came towards its end.
Price had begun as a footballer, playing for Wales in international football whilst maintaining a side career as a World Champion kickboxer. She had also been a part of the British developmental taekwondo squad before concentrating on boxing.

Although these two competitors were the favorites to win gold, there were other less likely contenders in Sydney. Derek Porter of Canada, for example, was the reigning Pan American champion, Olympic runner-up, and World bronze medalist, as well as the 1993 World Champion, and there were many other seasoned veterans at the Games such as Václav Chalupa, Jr. of the Czech Republic, Jüri Jaanson of Estonia, and Sergio Fernández of Argentina.
Waddell posted the fasted time in the opening round, with Porter, Müller, and Germany’s Marcel Hacker, victor in the 1999 Diamond Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta, winning the other heats. Fernández, meanwhile, was eliminated in the repêchage. Chalupa suffered the same fate in the semi-finals in a heat won Müller, while Waddell again took the round in the fastest time. The New Zealander’s success continued in the final, where he won the gold medal by a margin of over a second and a half. The next three finishers, however, had just over half a second between them and battled down to the line for the remaining podium spots. When the waves settled, Müller had just barely held on to silver, by 0.28 seconds, while Hacker had managed to steal bronze from Porter by 0.27 seconds. One other notable participant was Andris Reinholds of Latvia, who became the first Olympic rower to be disqualified from the Games for doping, as he tested positive for nandrolone. Even though he was eventually relegated to the B final, his participation might have had a small impact on the event, for he helped eliminate Fernández by winning his repêchage heat.

It was also the first team shooting event after 97 years, as shooting team events were discontinued after the 1924 Games. While in 1924 team events had at least four members per team, the teams in Tokyo consisted only of two shooters, so it was more of a pairs event. At the World Championships this event was first held in 2018 and had been won by Vitalina Batsarashkina/Artyom Chernousov, while silver went to Wang Qian/Wang Mengyi and bronze to Olena Kostevych/Oleh Omelchuk. Batsarashkina had already won Olympic gold in the women’s event two days earlier and the Chinese pair Jiang Ranxin/Pang Wei had each won a bronze medal in their individual events.

As Bhaker/Chaudhary only finished seventh in the second qualification stage, they did not reach the medal finals. At this stage the top two teams contested a gold medal match, while the third and fourth placed teams went to the bronze medal match. After six series of the gold medal match Batsarashkina/Chernousov led by 8 to 4, but the next four series were won by Jiang/Pang to give them a 12-8 lead.

Slåttvik had emerged as Hasu’s closest rival, winning the prestigious Holmenkollen Nordic Combined both in 1950 and 1951 and beating Hasu on both occations. In 1950 is was a very close contest, but in 1951 Hasu fell in two of his three jumps and was out of contention for the victory. Slåttvik had now moved from his birthplace in Nordland to Lillehammer, which made it much easier for him to train and participate in important competitions.
At the Olympic Games in Oslo, the schedule of events for the Nordic Combined had changed. For the first time the ski jumping was the first part of the competition, and the 18 km cross-country part was scheduled the day after, and as usual combined with the specialist’s race.
The audience of almost 30,000 held their breath when home favorite Slåttvik fell in his first jump measuring 67.5 m, the longest in the first round. The two best jumps of three counted, and the pressure was on Slåttvik. He produced two excellent jumps in superb style and ended as winner of the jumping event, 0.5 point better than his countryman Sverre Stenersen, a 25-year-old newcomer to the team and like Slåttvik also from the northern part of Norway. Stenersen had the longest jump of the day, jumping 69.5 m in the third round. Hasu, however, jumped better than expected and placed fifth in the event. He had to beat Slåttvik by 4:32 minutes in the cross-country, and that was considered quite possible since Hasu was an excellent cross-country skier, a medal candidate among the specialists.
Hasu again made an excellent 18 km, missing the bronze medal among the specialist with only 4 seconds and beating his closest rival among the Nordic Combined participants, his countryman Paavo Korhonen, by over three minutes. Slåttvik, however, made his best cross-country competition ever. With massive support from an enthusiastic home crowd, he crossed the finish line with a time only 3:16 behind Hasu, placing third in the cross-country and winning the Olympic gold with a clear margin. Stenersen was able to keep ahead of Korhonen and secured the bronze, even if he was beaten by Hasu by over seven minutes.

Favorite for the victory was the British Earl of Northesk, John Carnegie. In the week prior to the Olympic competition, Earl Northesk had first broken the track record (lowering it to 58.5 seconds), and then won the prestigious Grand National – the most important Cresta Run event.  However, in the first run of the competition he made a major mistake and broke one of his brakes, losing precious seconds. The other British entry, John Cuthbert Moore, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara, was also highly considered but fell off his sled at the Shuttlecock curve only 2 days before the Olympic event started, broke several ribs, and cut his face badly.  He did not start. With Northesk behind, the two American Heaton brothers could decide the title between them, with Jennison eventually taking the gold and  Jack the silver. Jack Heaton did quite well when one considers he was hampered by a broken wrist he had sustained only a few weeks before the Olympic race. Two of the ten competitors crashed, the Frenchman Pierre Dormeuil and Swiss Willy von Eschen both left the course involuntarily.

The start of the piste within the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center was located at an altitude of 1,370 metres right above “Big Pan” and followed almost the lower part of the downhill course. There was only one clear favorite, American Ted Ligety. He won the World Championships in giant slalom in both 2011 and 2013 as well as the giant slalom World Cup in 2010/11 and 2012/13. He had also won three of the five World Cup giant slaloms in the current season, in Sölden, Beaver Creek, and St. Moritz. The slope here in Sochi was described as similar to Beaver Creek which was also an advantage for Ligety. His biggest challengers were expected to be Marcel Hirscher, silver medalist at the 2013 World Championships and giant slalom World Cup winner in 2011/12, who won two races in this winter at Val d’Isère and Alta Badia, Felix Neureuther who won the World Cup giant slalom in Adelboden, Alexis Pinturault, and the silver medalist from Vancouver, and Kjetil Jansrud, who had already won two medals in Sochi. But Neureuther was handicaped after a car accident in Germany only five days before, causing whiplash. The current giant slalom World Cup standings saw Hirscher in the lead with Pinturault second, Ligety third, and Fanara fourth.
Pinturault was first down on the first run, and posted a challenging time of 1:22.44. This held the lead until his compatriot Thomas Fanara (FRA) bettered the time by just 0.03 seconds. Shortly afterwards Ligety posted a time of 1:21.08 which put him in the lead after the first run. No skier approached Ligety’s time, the best of the rest being surprising Ondřej Bank (CZE) who was 0.93 seconds behind, Davide Simoncelli (ITA) at 1.27 seconds behind and Matthias Mayer (AUT) who trailed by 1.33 seconds in the same time as Fanara.
With the top 30 going in reverse order on the second run, the first skier to make an impression on the medal positions was Steve Missillier (FRA), 10th after the first run, but in what was to prove the fastest time of the second run in 1:23.19, which put him into the lead with a combined time of 2:45.77. Pinturault then came close but failed by 0.16 seconds to overtake his compatriot. Fanara, Mayer and Simoncelli went without challenging the leaders, and for a while Hirscher found himself in bronze medal position. Bank was next on the course but, perhaps with memories of missing out in the Super Combined event when lying second, only managed the 15th fastest second run and slipped down to eventually finish fifth. Going last Ligety did not have the best race, and his 1.50 second lead over Missillier was gradually eroded, but he just held on to post a combined time of 2:45.29 and take the gold medal, ahead of the two Frenchmen.
Ligety won the fifth gold medal at this Games for skiing manufacturer Head, while Salomon won silver and bronze. Ondřej Bank achieved the best ever Alpine skiing result for a Czech men by finishing fifth. Finishing in 57th place was Luke Henri Steyn remarkable as being the first ever Winter Games competitor for Zimbabwe.

The eldest of three famous ski jumping brothers from Kongsberg was world champion in 1929. He was joined on the 1932 Norwegian ski jumping team by his brother Birger, who won the world championship in 1931, at only 19. Hans Beck, also a Kongsberg jumper and still only 20, and 19-year-old Kåre Walberg from Hamar completed the Norwegian team. It was a young team with lots of ski jumping talent. It is interesting to note that three of the four jumpers on the US team were born in Norway, Roy Mikkelsen also having been born in Kongsberg.
The lack of snow created big problems for the organizers, but due to strong efforts by driving snow into the jumping hill from locations higher up in the Adirondacks the ski jumping competition was organized as scheduled.
Beck made a perfect jump in the first round, 71.5 m., five meters longer than Birger Ruud in second place, and had a clear lead. Kongsberg-born Mikkelsen from the USA made a great effort, but was not able to land his 68.0 m. jump cleanly, fell and was injured, and had to withdraw from the second round. The Swede Sten Eriksson was in third place with a 65.5 m. jump, closely followed by Walberg, Sigmund Ruud, the winner of the Nordic combined jump competition Fritz Kaufmann, and the main US hope after Mikkelsen’s fall, Caspar Oimoen.
In the second round Beck tried to secure his gold medal without taking risks, and made a safe jump of 63.5 m. Birger Ruud saw his chance, gave all he had and made an excellent jump of 69.0 m., passing his club mate Beck by 1.1 points in the final classification. Walberg managed to narrowly pass Eriksson and secured a Norwegian triple. Oimoen satisfied the home crowd by producing the second best jump in the last round with 67.5 m. to place 5th.

Matouš missed four targets and was out of the fight for medals. Then Roetsch missed one target, but was one minute ahead of Kvalfoss when he left for the final 2.5 km to the finish. Of the late starters, only Angerer was expected to compete with Roetsch’s time, and he did. After a perfect standing shooting round he was over a minute ahead of his East German competitor, and easily secured the first ever Olympic biathlon gold medal for West Germany. Roetsch had no problems taking the silver medal ahead of fast finishing Kvalfoss. Ullrich was far from his former self, usually one of the fastest skiers, he lost three minutes to Kvalfoss in skiing time and had to be content with fifth place, behind Frenchman Yvon Mougel, who improved from sixth in 1980 to fourth in 1984.

Finishing in Sydney downpour, the winner was the Dutch rider Leontien Zijlaard-Van Moorsel over Germany’s Hanka Kupfernagel. Zijlaard-Van Moorsel’s performance at the 2000 Olympics rivals any in cycling history. She won the road race, the individual time trial, the 3,000 metre individual pursuit on the track, and won a silver medal in the points race on the track. She won the World Championships on the roads in 1991 and 1993, and in the Time Trial in 1998-99, and was a four-time individual pursuit World Champion (1990, 2001-03). Her career occurred in two phases. After 1993, she suffered from anorexia nervosa and lost almost 20 kg. (44 lbs.). But she recovered and returned to international cycling in the late 90s to enjoy her greatest successes.

There were 33 competitors in this event, from 13 societes, with 11 individuals receiving prizes. It is not considered an Olympic event, despite the title, because it was open only to competitors from the Sociétés de la Seine. It consisted not only of gymnastics events, but weightlifting and wrestling were part of the all-around competition. The event was won by Albert Barodet, who also competed in the gymnastics event considered as the Olympic all-around, but a measure of the level of competition in this event is that Barodet finished 105th in the Olympic all-around.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"On the fourth day of the Olympic weightlifting competition two women’s events were held on the same day for the first time in Olympic history. The first of them was the women’s lightweight class, contested up to 59 kg, after being held up to 58 kg from 2000-16. The clear favourite was Kuo Hsing-Chun, who won a bronze medal in the 58 kg class in Rio, but since then she had been unbeaten, winning world titles in 2017 (58 kg), 2018, and 2019, as well as winning the Asian Championships in 2017 (58 kg), 2019 and 2020 (held in 2021). Furthermore, she was the world record holder in snatch (110 kg), clean & jerk (140 kg), and total (247 kg). She achieved the snatch and total record shortly before the Olympics in April 2021. The snatch world record was previously held by Choe Hyo-Sim, but she did not compete in Tokyo due to the renouncement of PRK. China’s former clean & jerk world record holder Chen Guiming, and Luo Xiaomin, second in the season ranking with 227 kg, and silver medallist at the last Asian Championships, were not present as this was one of the three weight classes China had chosen to meet the determination of only four female athletes per nation. Consequently, this was the first weightlifting event in Tokyo with no Chinese competitor. Not present in Tokyo also were Janeth Gómez, season best 220 kg, and Rosive Silgado (COL), and Taylor Wilkins (USA), both with a season best of 217 kg. This gave medal chances to Yusleidy Figueroa, season best 218 kg, Hoàng Thị Duyên, qualification best 223 kg, and Alexandra Escobar with a qualification best of 220 kg.
When Kuo started her snatch attempts all other athletes had finished and there had been some surprises. Hoàng, known as a good snatcher, lifted only 95 kg, which put her behind Polina Guryeva and Dora Tchakounté, who both cleared 96 kg, while Escobar failed to set a valid attempt when she missed 95 kg three times. A good performance was shown by Mikiko Ando clearing 94 kg, while Figueroa cleared 91 kg, but she was better at clean & jerk. Kuo finally lifted 103 kg for a comfortable lead. In the clean & jerk Guryeva lifted 119 kg in her second attempt to put her in the lead. When Hoàng missed 119 kg twice, and Tchakounté missed 120 kg, a weight that was cleared by Ando in her third attempt, the Japanese moved into second place. Only Figueroa was still fighting for a medal but she missed 125 kg. Kuo cleared 125 kg in her first attempt, which gave her the gold medal, with Guryeva taking silver and Ando bronze. Finally, Kuo tried to lift 141 kg in her last attempt. It would have been a new world record, but she failed.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 102 kg for snatch, 127 kg for clean & jerk, and 229 kg for total. All three were achieved by Kou, who cleared 103 kg and 133 kg for a total of 236 kg.
The silver medal won by Guryeva was the first ever Olympic medal for Turkmenistan. The gold medal won by Kuo was the fourth Olympic gold medal for Chinese Taipei in weightlifting, their most successful sport at the Olympics, and all their gold medals had been won by women, one at each of the last four Olympics. The bronze medal for Ando was the only weightlifting medal for the host nation in Tokyo. Escobar competed in her fifth Olympics to become the third woman to do so, only three days after Hiromi Miyake and Dika Toua achieved that feat. Also competing in this event was the first ever weightlifting competitor at the Olympics for Botswana, but as Magdeline Moyengwa failed to set a valid lift in clean & jerk she was unplaced.

Fikotová regained the lead and won the gold medal with her fifth round throw of 53.69 (176-1¾), Beglyakova holding on for the silver. Romashkova never really factored for the gold but won the bronze. Fikotová also made headlines during the Olympics because she began a much publicized East-West romance with American hammer thrower, Hal Connolly. Overcoming what was described as “mountains of red tape” they fell in love and were married in Praha three months after the Olympics, with Czech distance running legend Emil Zátopek serving as best man. Connolly and Fikotová divorced in 1973. Fikotová-Connolly would eventually compete in five Olympics, the next four representing the United States.

This was mostly of consequence for the Eastern European teams, which all played with state sponsored amateurs, and title defender Hungary had to leave several of their star players at home. When the draw for the tournament was published, Morocco withdrew its team, refusing to play against Israel. They were replaced by Ghana. The Israeli team was unlucky to be eliminated in the quarter-finals. Following a 1-1 draw after overtime with Bulgaria, lots were drawn to decide the winner, as had been the case in the 1960 Olympic semi-final. Bulgaria proceeded to eliminate the home team in the semi-finals. Hungary meanwhile defeated the tournament’s surprise, the Japanese squad that eventually took home the bronze medal.
The final was a disgrace to football. The Hungarians were leading by 2-1 when Bulgaria’s Dimitrov was sent off for a tackle from behind. A second expulsion soon followed, when Ivkov committed a rough offense. This angered Khristov, who shot the ball towards Mexican referee De Leo. While De Leo could not see the offender, the linesman was paying attention. Khristov was also removed from play, leaving the Bulgarians with only eight.

Belgium had Eugène Van Roosbroeck in this second group, while Britain’s third rider, Ian Scott, was over eight minutes behind the lead, and this decided the team event – Belgium winning the gold and Great Britain the silver medal.
The Belgian champions, however, did not realize they had won a gold medal. They thought there was only an individual race in 1948 and simply got on the bus after the ride, and were back in Belgium the next day. They were never given gold medals at the London Olympics. But Van Roosbroeck later learned that they had won the team event and petitioned the IOC to have medals awarded to them. On 9 June 2010, Eugène Van Roosbroeck finally received his gold medal for this event, presented to him by IOC President Jacques Rogge.

It was a new addition to the Olympic Games but featured in the UCI Track Cycling World Championships where, for three of the past four years, it was dominated by Australians Kaarle McCulloch and Anna Meares. Their only loss had come in the most recent edition, when the Germans Kristina Vogel and Miriam Welte burst onto the scene and stole the title, twice setting a world record during the event. The British team of Vicki Pendleton and Jessica Varnish, as well as the Chinese team Gong Jinjie and Guo Shuang, were considered to be strong competitors as well, although many believed that the gold medal match would come to a showdown between the Germans and the Australians.
Unfortunately, the event’s début at the Olympics bordered on disastrous. It began with a fairly auspicious start, with Great Britain setting a world record in the qualification round that was almost immediately broken by the Chinese. In the semi-finals, however, Great Britain won their heat with the second fastest time in the round, thus allowing them the opportunity to compete for gold, but lost the chance when they were relegated for an early exchange – Pendleton passed Varnish too early – disqualifying them from the competition. Australia won its heat, but only posted the third-fastest time (even after Britain’s relegation) and were left to contest bronze against Ukraine. China seemed to be the only team that fared well in this round, once again setting a world record, but met the same fate as the British in the semis. Even though the Chinese team earned gold in their race against Germany, they were relegated to silver for an early exchange of their own. Australia, meanwhile, easily won its match and took home bronze, but seemed somewhat disheartened at the missed opportunity to take the inaugural Olympic title.

Australia’s James Tomkins, a double Olympic champion in the coxless fours from 1992 and 1996, was one half of the reigning World Champions, but his partner, Drew Ginn, suffered a back injury and could not attend his home Olympics, and thus Tomkins brought Matthew Long instead. The other two recent World Champions, France and Germany, sent their victorious crews to the Games. France, represented by Michel Andrieux and Jean-Christophe Rolland, was the 1997 World champion, the 1999 World runner-up, and the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist. Germany, meanwhile, had Robert Sens and Detlef Kirchhoff, the 1998 World Champions. Kirchhoff also had three previous Olympic medals in other disciplines. Great Britain would attempt to defend its title with Ed Coode and Greg Searle, a 1992 Olympic champion in the coxed pairs and 1996 bronze medalist in the coxless fours.
The Britons posted the fastest time in the opening round, with Serbia and Montenegro (the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) only 0.17 seconds slower in winning their own heat with Đorđe Višacki and Nikola Stojić. France was the slowest of the three in capturing its own heat, but was fastest in the semi-finals, with Australia barely emerging victorious in its own heat against Serbia and Montenegro. In the final, France retained its strength and won gold by a margin of a nearly a second, while the American duo of Ted Murphy and Sebastian Bea snuck in for a surprise second-place finish. Murphy had been one half of the bronze medal-winning boat at the 1997 World Championships and had earned a silver medal in the coxed fours in 1994, while Bea was a 1997 gold medalist in the coxed eights.

But she had never won a major international in the long jump. Back was perennial favorite Heike Drechsler, gold medalist from Barcelona and winner of the last four European Championships. Italy’s Fiona May was also a threat but she had a habit of finishing second in major championships – 1996 Olympics, 1999 Worlds, 1998 Europeans, although she had been World Champion in 1995. Drechsler, May and Jones decided the medals, in that order, in round three, as they all produced their best efforts in that round. May and Jones tied with 6.92 (22-8½) and it fell to the countback with May winning with a best second mark of 6.82 (22-4½) produced in round two. Jones had only one other legal mark.
But the results of this event and every 2000 event in which Marion Jones competed are not what they seem. Dogged by rumors of drug use, Jones was married to shot putter C. J. Hunter and during the Sydney Olympics it was revealed that he tested positive for steroids several times earlier in the year. They later divorced, and she then married sprinter Tim Montgomery. In 2003 he was found to have participated with the BALCO Scandal and was banned for two years by the IAAF. In 2006 Jones almost tested positive for the only time in her career, with a sample showing use of eryrthropoietin (EPO) after the US Championships. But her B sample was negative and it was not considered a positive drug test. Shortly thereafter Montgomery was charged in a check-kiting scheme and Jones was implicated as well, and they later divorced. She then married Barbadian sprinter Obadele Thompson, who had, at least, no drug charges against him. In October 2007, Jones admitted to federal prosecutors that she had lied to them and had used steroids in the months prior to the Sydney Olympics. Her 2000 results were stricken by the IAAF and the medals were returned to the IOC.

New Zealand’s Jack Lovelock was a Rhodes Scholar and trained in 1931-32 at Oxford, where he ran 4:12.0 at the 1932 University Championships. Italy’s Luigi Beccali was a determined runner but with only fair results prior to 1932, when he posted a 4:11.5 mile in Milan on May 15. The top American was likely Glenn Cunningham who won the 1932 NCAA mile in 4:11.1 for the University of Kansas. But even beyond these three, other top runners were present, including Canada’s Phil Edwards, who was born in British Guiana.
At Los Angeles, the three heats were won by Lovelock, Beccali, and Cunningham, who posted the best time of 3:55.8 in winning the first heat. In the final, Lovelock took the field thru a first 400 of 60.5, but Cunningham took the lead on the second lap. Edwards then moved ahead to lead at 800 metres, done in 2:04.5. Cunningham attempted to jump the field on the third lap, but Edwards stayed with him, and he led thru 1,200 in 3:07.0. He then started to pull away over the last lap. Cunningham looked beaten but Beccali, Lovelock, and Britain’s John “Jerry” Cornes took off after Edwards. On the last curve, Lovelock tied up completely and would finish seventh. Beccali passed Cunningham on the final curve and rushed past Edwards with 100 metres left, pulling away to a comfortable margin. Cornes took the silver, and Edwards held off Cunningham for the bronze.
Frenchman Jules Ladoumègue, who held the world records at 1000m, 1500m, the mile and 2000m was declared a professional earlier in the year and denied a shot at the Olympic title.

The extrovert hurdler Lolo Jones had been at the centre of the media furore but it was Lauryn Williams, a member of the US team that won gold in the 4×100 metre relay at London 2012 who stood at the brink of a historic triumph. Only once in the history of the Olympic Games had an athlete won gold at both Summer and Winter Games – was Eddie Eagan’s unique feat about to be matched after 82 years?
The US team had switched pairings throughout the season but when the Olympic selection was announced she found herself partnering Elana Meyers, the silver medal winner from the 2013 World Championships, and therefore in a strong position to challenge for the title.  Their main rivals appeared to be the reigning Olympic champion combination of Canadians Kaillie Humphries and Heather Moyse who were back together again after Moyse had spent most of the intervening Olympiad competing for Canada internationally at both rugby and cycling.
Meyers and Williams used their trademark explosive start to shine on the first day of competition and, whilst Meyers’ driving may not have been up to the standard of her Canadian rival, they recorded the fastest times on both runs. The Canadians responded by posting the best time on run 3 but the American team still maintained a healthy lead of .11 of a second as they entered the final run. Humphries had a clean and fast ride down the track on her 4th run putting pressure back on the American duo. Meyers and Williams made an excellent start but halfway down the run it deteriorated into a game of pinball between the walls of ice. They recovered a little but the damage was done and the Canadians became the first women to successfully retain an Olympic title. Whilst Williams didn’t quite join Eddie Eagan in the ranks of Olympic immortals, she did have the satisfaction of being only the 3rd woman after Clara Hughes and Christa Luding-Rothenburger to medal in both summer and winter. Jamie Greubel drove USA II into the bronze medal position ahead of a Dutch team which recorded its best result in Olympic bobsleigh by placing 4th.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
Olga Stulneva and Lyudmila Udobkina, who originally finished ninth, were disqualified in November-December 2017. Appeals were made immediately to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which are ongoing.
A special committee of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) was then charged with investigating these findings, but refused to acknowledge the disqualifications and allowed all the sliders to continue competing. The IOC was not happy with that ruling and the Executive Committee of the IBSF then appealed to the CAS, against its own sub-committee, to have that ruling overturned.

At 14 years, 309 days old, Kuzuo Kitamura remains to this day the youngest male winner of an individual Olympic gold medal.

Eschbach, Germany” for the work “Ode to Sport,” which was submitted in three languages - French, English, and German.  But in reality, the poetic ode had been written by Pierre, Baron de Coubertin, who entered it in the competitions under the dual pseudonym.  Coubertin had used the name Georges Hohrod previously, publishing an autobiographic novel Le Roman d’un rallié, under that pseudonym in 1899.  It is believed that M. Eschbach was his wife, Marie (née Rothan), who grew up partly in Germany, and that she translated the work into German.
But what of the names Hohrod and Eschbach?  Until recently, the source of the names was not known.  But an article by Jean Durry in Olympic Review has shed light on the mystery.  Durry attempted to find the home in Luttenbach that had once belonged to the Rothan family, Coubertin’s in-laws. Driving in the Fecht Valley near Alsace, Durry came across the small town of Hohrodberg.  Very near Hohrodberg, Durry also found the small town of Eschbach-au-Val. Although he does not describe it in as much detail, this was noted earlier (1994) by Norbert Müller, who wrote in a footnote in his book on Olympic Congresses, “The author of this book discovered that the pseudonyms Hohrod and Eschbach were the names of two neighboring villages of the native village of Coubertin’s wife, Luttenbach, near Colmar.”

The world champion was Jani Sievinen of Finland, who was on a run of 39 final victories in the event, while the world record holder at 400 metres, America’s Tom Dolan, and his compatriot Greg Burgess were his chief rivals. Dolan’s stock rose when he won his favoured 400 IM just as Sievinen’s fell when he failed to reach the final.
Sievinen returned to form and was the fastest qualifier for the final ahead of Dutchman Marcel Wouda and Canada’s Curtis Myden. Myden led the field for the first 50 metres but on the backstroke leg Attila Czene of Hungary, swimming over in lane one, forged ahead. The pack gained on him during the second half of the race and Sievinen was pressing him hard at the finish but Czene was able to hold off his pursuers and gain a surprising victory.
A month after the Games it was revealed how lucky Czene was to be competing in Atlanta. A few weeks prior to the Olympics he had still not recorded a qualifying time so the Hungarian Swimming Federation invented a non-existent meeting and submitted concocted times to the IOC to ensure he (and a dozen other swimmers) were eligible to compete in Atlanta. The Hungarian Swimming Federation were punished for their dishonesty although Czene was allowed to keep his Olympic title.

He also beat Slovenia’s Adrian Gomboc. The Slovenian was the only opponent lower than Basile in the ranking list and in the semi-final he resisted Basile for the complete five minutes but lost by two Shidos (penalties) for non-combativity. In the final Basile faced the top ranked reigning World Champion An Ba-Ul of Korea. Basile surprised him with a Seoi-otoshi (back-drop) scoring an Ippon just 1:24 min into the bout.

He had moved up to second at the 2013 World Championships, before taking the title in 2014 and 2015 and setting a world record in the process. One potential competitor was Spain’s Saúl Craviotto, who had been the runner-up in London and was already in top form after winning the K-2 200 earlier in the Games. Great Britain’s Ed McKeever was the champion in London, but in Rio his nation was represented by Liam Heath, the 2016 European Champion, who had already won a silver medal in the K-2 200.
Of these three competitors, only Heath managed to win his preliminary heat. Craviotto finished behind Maxime Beaumont of France, the 2015 World runner-up, while de Jonge was third in a heat won by Germany’s Ronald Rauhe, a decorated canoeist with five K-1 200 World Championship titles dating back to 2001. De Jonge struggled again in the semifinals, placing fourth in his heat behind Heath, Rauhe, and Craviotto and avoiding elimination by a mere 0.003 seconds. Beaumont was the winner of the other semifinal. In the final, Beaumount started in the lead but was soon passed by Heath, who held on to capture gold a mere 0.165 seconds ahead of the Frenchman. In the race for bronze, it appeared at first that Craviotto had barely edged out Rauhe, but a closer examination of the finish revealed that they had both crossed the line at exactly 35.662 seconds, and thus both were awarded third place.

All fighters losing to the finalists in each pool advance to repêchage tournament for the bronze medal.,na,"Joel González of Spain had stepped up a division since winning the flyweight gold medal at London 2012 and was optimistic about winning a second gold, particularly after winning silver in the 63kg class at the 2015 World Championships. A strong favourite for the featherweight title, however, was Turkey’s Servet “The Cheetah” Tazegül, who won in 2012 and was the reigning European and World 68kg Champion, but there were plenty of others to pick from. Seeded one place above Tazegül, in fourth place, was Russia’s Aleksey Denisenko, who the Turk beat in the 2015 world final in what was described as one of the all-time great taekwondo matches and one many would like to see repeated as the 2016 Olympic final.
The number one seed, and 2015 63kg world champion, was Belgium’s Jaouad Achab, a flamboyant fighter who was great to watch despite being a bit too light in this 68kg category. The experienced South Korean Lee Dae-Hun was number two seed and was a silver medallist in 2012 behind the Spaniard González. The third seed Saúl Gutiérrez of Mexico was a 63kg bronze medallist at the 2015 worlds and he was tall, which is a big advantage for attempting head kicks.
Unlike the first day of completion, when the favourites fell by the wayside in the early part of competition, the 68kg class went much to form with Gutiérrez being the only one of the top six seeds to fall in the first round. The fans got the re-run of the Tazegül – Denisenko contest in the quarter-final but, unlike the World Championship final, it was far from a classic as the Russian ran out a 19-6 winner on the points gap rule in the second round.
In the first repêchage, Tazegül, the now deposed defending champion and number five seed, was defeated by 13th seed Edgar Contreras of Venezuela in the golden point sudden-death after a 4-4 tie. The first of the bronze medal matches saw Contreras against González hold out for a 4-3 win. The other bronze medal match was between the number one and two seeds, Jaouad Achab and Lee Dae-Hun, and it was a great contest which Lee won 11-7, but the scoreline does not tell the full story of a match that saw the lead change hands several times in the first two rounds.
In the gold medal match, the fourth seed Denisenko had impressed all day with his wide array of skills, whilst the tenth seed Jordanian Ahmad Abughaush had become a favourite of the fans with his footwork and variety of kicks; thus the final was between two men of different contrasts. The Jordanian opened up a one point lead in round two after a scoreless opening round, but that one point was all that separated the two men at the end of the round. Abughaush built up a lead of 7-2 and then 10-2 in the third round by which time it looked over and despite a late flourish from the Russian, Jordan won their first ever Olympic medal in any sport, thanks to Abughaush’s 10-6 win.

He would have been heavily favored. In his absence, Japan’s Yoshiyuki Matsuoka, runner-up to Solodukhin in 1983, was considered the likely winner. Others to watch were Marc Alexandre (FRA), the 1984 European Champion, and Korean Hwang Jeong-O, bronze medalist at the 1981 Worlds. The two pool finals were very different matches. Alexandre met Matsuoka in what would have been a great final. The Japanese attacked from the start, but Alexandre countered and it was not until the final seconds that Matsuoka made it thru to the gold medal match. The other pool final was met by derisive boos, as Hwang met Italy’s Sandro Rosati, and the match was marked by multiple passivity warnings, and very little wrestling. In the final, Matsuoka continued to show his dominance, as Hwang was never in the match, but did last for seven minutes, with Matsuoka winning with a yuko by seoi-nage at the five minute mark.

During training runs on the Olympic course both German teams surprisingly struggled and looks set to miss the medal positions. The decision was made to withdrew one of their teams and enter a composite crew made of the two man champions Ostler and Nieberl, together with the two heaviest members of the other German foursome. This proved to be a winning combination and the crew posted the fastest time of all four runs to win the championships and Ostler became the first man to do the two man / four man double at an Olympic Games.

For the European Championships it was Achim Hill, who had won silver medals for a unified German team at the past two Olympics, as well as the 1966 Diamond Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta, and was now seeking the top spot for East Germany. The world champion, Donald Spero of the United States, was not present in Mexico City and his nation was represented by John Van Blom, but the Pan American champion, Argentina’s Alberto Demiddi, did attend. Great Britain, meanwhile, sent the runner-up from the Diamond Challenge Sculls, Kenneth Dwan, instead of winner Hugh Wardell-Yerburgh. Also notable were Canada’s Roger Jackson, a 1964 Olympic champion in the coxless pairs, and Czechoslovakia’s Václav Kozák, a 1960 Olympic gold medalist in the double sculls. Ivanov’s successor, meanwhile, was the relatively untested Viktor Melnikov.
The fastest time in the opening round, however, went to Jan Wienese of the Netherlands, bronze medalist at the last two editions of the European Championships and runner-up at the 1966 World Championships. The other heat winners were Jochen Meißner of West Germany, the 1965 European Champion, 1966 World silver medalist, and the 1967 runner-up in the Diamond Challenge Sculls, who had been considered a slight favorite prior to the Games, and the relatively unknown Niels Henry Secher of Denmark, whose time was beaten in other heats by Hill and Demiddi. Wienese and Hill took their heats in the semi-finals, although Demiddi in Wienese’s heat had a faster time than Hill. Melnikov, Kozák, Jackson, and Secher, meanwhile, were all eliminated for having failed to finish within the top six, which was rounded out by Van Blom, Meißner, and Dwan. In the final, Wienese moved to the front just after the first half and remained there for the rest of the race, winning by a comfortable margin of over four seconds. Meißner, therefore, settled for silver well ahead of Demiddi, whose bronze was an improvement on his fourth-place finish from the 1964 Games. Wienese had thus won the Netherlands’ first Olympic gold medal in rowing since 1924.

But two other Americans began to challenge him in the interim between Olympics.  John Paul Jones, a college runner at Cornell, won the IC4A title in both 1911 and 1912.  But a Philadelphia high school student, James Edwin “Ted“ Meredith, of Mercersburg Academy, came to prominence at both 440 and 880 yards early in 1912, setting interscholastic records at both distances only a few weeks before the Olympic trials.  At the eastern Olympic Trials, Meredith ran third behind Sheppard.
The best of the Europeans were Germany’s Hanns Braun, who had won the AAA title in 1911 and 1912, and Italy’s Emilio Lunghi, who equalled Sheppard’s world record of 1:52.8 (set at the London Olympics) in winning the 1909 Canadian Championship.  At La Spezia, on 23 June, Lunghi confirmed his fitness with a 400/800 double of 49.0 and 1:55.0.
The five favorites all survived the first round, but John Paul Jones did not compete in the semi-finals.  The American trainer, Michael Murphy, thought he had a better chance at 1,500 metres, so he withdrew Jones to save him for the longer race.  In the second semi, Lunghi faltered in the stretch and finished fifth, one place from qualifying for the final.
In the final, Mel Sheppard led out at a very fast pace, reaching 400 metres in 52.4.  But entering the homestretch, Sheppard could not hold off Ted Meredith, who won by inches in a world record time of 1:51.9.  Ira Davenport (USA) came up fast in the last 200 metres to take the bronze medal.  Meredith continued to a second tape set at 880 yards, passing that mark in 1:52.5, also a world record.
The official results for the non-medalists, from the Official Report, were 4) Braun 1:52.2; 5) David Caldwell 1:52.3; and 6) Melville Brock - no time.  But concerning places 4-6, Olympic Track & Field states that, “However, these places and times do not stand up under close scrutiny of available photographs and reports from various sources.  We here list ‘revised’ results.”  The revised results that they listed were 4) Brock 1:52.7e; 5) Caldwell 1:52.8e; and 6) Braun 1:53.1e.
Quercetani and Kök describe this problem as follows: “Even the expert Swedish judges made mistakes in determining the other places, notably in giving a fourth place to Braun in 1:52.2, a time which the German federation recognized in … 1924.  In reality, the most dependable witnesses say that the exhausted Braun finished in slow motion, beaten by Caldwell and possibly even by Brock.  Without guaranteeing absolute exactness (photographs, taken mostly before the finish and at different angles, don’t help much) the order of finish from fourth onwards can be tentatively reconstructed as follows (times are estimated): 4. Caldwell 1:52.8; 5. Brock 1:53; 6. Braun 1:53; 7. Hec Edmundsen; 8. Herbert Putnam.”

Although the international level of basketball was improving, the USA was still considered a heavy favorite. The US team included future NBA players Doug Collins, Kevin Joyce, Tom McMillen, Tommy Burleson, Bobby Jones, and Tom Henderson. Thru eight games, the United States extended its unbeaten streak and reached the final game against the Soviet Union. But US coach Hank Iba played somewhat of an old-style slowdown-type offense, emphasizing defense and never really released his horses.
The final between the Soviet Union and the United States produced the greatest controversy in Olympic basketball history. Trailing with less 10 seconds left, Doug Collins stole a pass and headed for an “almost” uncontested lay-up. But he was intentionally fouled by the Soviet player Sako Sak’andelidze, which was necessary to prevent the automatic two points. When Collins sank two free throws with three seconds left, it gave the US a 50-49 lead, its first of the game. The Soviets attempted to inbound the ball. After the inbounds pass, referee Renato Righetto stopped play, as the Soviet coach claimed a time-out had been called. The Soviets were allowed to attempt another inbound play, and the clock was set back to one second. An inbound pass was thrown but time quickly ran out, and the American players began to celebrate wildly.
However, William Jones, the Secretary-General of FIBA then intervened and ordered the shot clock re-set at three seconds and allowed the final inbounds pass to be re-played again.  Ivan Yedeshko threw a perfect pass to Aleksandr Belov who scored a lay-up over Joyce and McMillan. The US protested but to no avail. US dominance in Olympic basketball was officially over. The US players refused to accept the silver medals, leaving the second step of the podium empty, and continue to do so to this day. In fact, one US player, Kenneth Davis, has had it written into his last will and testament that no member of his family is ever to accept a silver medal for basketball from the 1972 Olympics, even after his death.

The battle for bronze was quite close between the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the United States, and Bulgaria. Unfortunately it came down to a decision with political overtones. During their uneven bars rotation, US alternate Rhonda Faehn was charged with removing the springboard used by the gymnasts to mount the bars. But instead of leaving the competition area, she stayed on the podium to watch Kelly Garrison-Steves perform her routine. For this the Americans were penalized 5/10ths of a point by the President of the Technical Committee of the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), Ellen Berger. Berger was from East Germany, and the penalty margin gave the bronze medal to East Germany, with the US finishing fourth, 3/10ths of a point behind. US coach Bela Karolyi, a Romanian emigré, went ballistic, calling Berger “a cow” and the ruling “a Communist plot.”

Ahead of her at that tournament had been Australia’s Britteny Cox, who had come third in 2015, and France’s Perrine Laffont, who had been 14th at the last Winter Games, but had also captured the dual moguls title at the 2017 Worlds. Other medal contenders included Justine’s sister Chloé, the 2014 Olympic runner-up, and Jaelin Kauf of the United States, ranked #1 in the World Cup standings.
There were few surprises in the first qualification round, although Chloé Dufour-Lapointe had to compete in the second qualifying round in order to advance to the finals. Laffont finished at the top of the pack, but only 0.12 points separated her from Canadian Andi Naude, a promising newcomer who was ranked #2 in the World Cup standings. American Morgan Schild came in an unexpected third, and was followed by Justine Dufour-Lapointe, Kauf, and Cox. Both Chloé Dufour-Lapointe and Schild performed disappointingly in the first run of the final and failed to advance. On the other hand, Justine’s performance suggested that she was in fantastic form to defend her gold medal. The second run was won convincingly by Naude, with Cox not far behind in her performance, while Kauf just missed the cut-off and was eliminated. Behind Naude and Cox were Laffont, Justine Dufour-Lapointe, the relatively unknown Jakara Anthony of Australia, and Kazakhstan’s Yuliya Galysheva, competing in her third Olympics.
This lineup promised an exciting finale, and the competitors did not disappoint. Galysheva went first and put on a strong showing that would end up securing her the bronze medal, which was her country’s first Olympic podium finish in the sport. After an admirable, but ultimately insufficient, run from Anthony, Dufour-Lapointe’s performed impressively and put herself ahead of the others and in a strong position to claim gold once again. Laffont, however, was next and offered an excellent show in the round’s quickest time, enough to place her ahead of Dufour-Lapointe by 0.09 points. With Cox scoring lower than Anthony and Naude skiing off course, the podium was set, with Laffont taking gold and Dufour-Lapointe having to settle for silver.

In spite of her love of this event none of her previous four Olympic medals had come in the 10 km classic, and her first appearance in Sochi in the skiathlon had been a major disappointment.
Starting at 30 second intervals, the early leader was Russia’s Nataliya Zhukova who would eventually finish seventh overall. The first competitor to beat this time was German Stefanie Böhler, whose eventual sixth place was a major achievement, after a malignant tumor was discovered in her thyroid gland in 2012, which required two operations for removal. Finland’s Aino-Kaisa Saarinen became the first skier to beat 29 minutes, but this time still did not get her into the medal ranks. Starting as 43rd runner, Kowalczyk dominated the event from the start. She led at the 2.2 km mark and at the 5 km point, increased her advantage to 9.1 sec over Norway’s Marit Bjørgen, who had dominated the 10 km together with Kowalczyk for the last four years. Bjørgen was still on the silver medal rank at the 8 km mark, now 19.1 seconds behind Kowalczyk. But the Norwegian had raced in the sprints and tired badly in the final two kilometres, finishing fifth. Justyna Kowalczyk completed the course 18.4 seconds ahead of Sweden’s defending Olympic champion Charlotte Kalla, to take the gold. The bronze medal eventually went to Therese Johaug of Norway, the 2013 world champion and World Cup leader.
By winning the gold medal, Kowalczyk became the most decorated Polish athlete in Olympic Winter Games history, beating the record of four medals that she shared with ski jumper Adam Małysz.

After five rounds, Tapio and Sapunov were eliminated on bad points. After six rounds, three wrestlers remained – Horvat, Greek Petros Galaktopoulos and Japan’s Munji Munemura, neither of whom had ever made a podium at a major international. Horvat drew with Munemura and Galaktopoulos, which gave the gold medal to the little-known Munemura, who had defeated Galaktopoulos in round six, as Horvat settled for silver and Galaktopoulos took bronze.

The 14 year old Willy den Ouden from the Netherlands had broken the Olympic record in reaching the final and looked set to mount a strong challenge to Madison.  The American started the final strongly and built up a clear lead but with 25 metres to go she clipped the lane dividers and lost speed.

The United States won the event, led by Becky Dyroen-Lancer, who was certainly deprived of more medals by the change in the program. Since the 1992 Olympics, she had recorded nine consecutive Grand Slams – winning solo, duet, team, and figures titles at every meet, including the 1994 World Championships and 1995 Pan-American Games. The French team caused controversy with their plans for the original routine, which was to consist of an enactment of Jewish women at a concentration camp making their final walk to the gas chambers. Shortly before the Olympics, they were convinced of how inappropriate this was and French IOC Member and Minister of Sports, Guy Drut, forbade from using their original routine.

McKeown was over two seconds faster than any swimmer in Tokyo for the event.
In the semi-finals Australia’s Emily Seebohm posted the fastest qualifier, followed by Americans Phoebe Bacon and Rhyan White, with McKeown only qualifying fifth, also trailing Canadian Kylie Masse. The final was made up of swimmers from four countries, with Australia, Canada, China, and the USA all getting both of their entrants into the top eight.
Masse led most of the way in the final, holding a 0.69 second lead over McKeown entering the final lap, but the Australian was too strong at the end, passing Masse, and winning easily in 2:04.68, as Masse finished in 2:05.42. Behind them Seebohm took bronze in her fourth Olympics, while White and Bacon finished fourth and fifth, respectively.
For McKeown this completed the backstroke double, having won the 100 back four days earlier, as Masse also finished second in that race. McKeown would eventually win four medals, and three golds, in Tokyo with gold in the women’s medley relay and a bronze in the mixed medley relay, which was swum later on the same day as the 200 back final.

Shooters shot 40 shots from 300 metres in a kneeling position for a possible of 400 points. This event was a part of the 3-position free rifle event which was shot concurrently for individuals and teams, and like the other two elements, prone and standing, it counted as a separate event with medals being awarded accordingly. It was the only time at the Olympics that this happened.
For the first and only time, the World Championships were held concurrently with the Olympics and the Olympic Champions also became World Champions. It was the fourth staging of the World Championships, having previously been held in Lyon (France) in 1897, Turin (Italy) 1898 and Loosduinen 1899 which, since 1923 has been a district of Den Haag (Netherlands).
Konrad Stäheli of Switzerland had won the last two World Championships and was favourite to defend his title in Paris. The 1899 silver and bronze medallists, Emil Kellenberger (Switzerland) and Henrik Sillem (Netherlands), who was also the 1897 bronze medallist, were also competing, as were the 1898 French silver and bronze medallists Achille Paroche and Léon Moreaux. All the World Championship medallists since 1897 appeared in Paris with the exception of the 1897 gold and silver medallists Frank Jullien and Alcide Hirschy, both from Switzerland.
Konrad Stäheli, was in a class of his own and won the first Olympic title and with it, his third World championship title in this event. He would go on to add another seven world titles to his collection, in 1901-02 and 1910-1914, for a total of ten titles. He won four medals, including three golds in 1900, but despite his long career, appeared in just one more Olympics, at the 1906 Intercalated Games when he added a gold and silver medal to his tally.

Two compulsory dives were made from the 5-metre platform, a running plain dive and a backward somersault; and two were made from the 10-metre platform, a standing plain dive and a running plain dive.  The optional dives were made from the 10-metre platform.
Sweden dominated this event, advancing seven to the semi-finals, and having the first four finishers in the final.  America’s Polish emigré George Gaidzik was a favorite, as he had won the 1908 British highboard championship earlier in the summer.  Gaidzik the highest total in the first round but he performed very poorly in the finals.  Hjalmar Johansson dominated the finals, and had trailed only Gaidzik in the qualifying rounds.  He was the diving champion of Sweden from 1897 through 1908, except for 1900 and 1903 when he lived in London.  He was also an accomplished swimmer, holding the Swedish record for the 100 breaststroke at the time of the 1908 Olympics.  The two other Swedish medallists, Karl Malmström and Arvid Spångberg, were relative newcomers to diving.
In the preliminaries to this event, George Cane (GBR) had a poor dive and passed out upon landing.  Spectators and officials were not certain why he was not leaving the pool.  Hjalmar Johansson, the eventual gold medalist, realized what had happened and dove in to rescue Cane.  Fortunately, Cane was quickly revived and sustained no major injuries.
In the semi-finals, George Gaidzik (USA), one of the favorites, finished 3rd and did not qualify for the final.  He was actually briefly disqualified, as one of the judges felt he was receiving signals (coaching) from a teammate on the ground.  The judges’s scores for Gaidzik were as follows:  one gave him an 8, a 6, and a 9; one gave him a 9 for each dive; while the third judge scored him 0 for each dive, and disqualified him, based on the above reasoning.  The Americans protested, and after consideration by the judges, the protest was upheld and Gaidzik was advanced as an extra diver to the final.

Eventually, the medal pool consisted of Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, and Great Britain.  Canada dominated the competition, defeating Sweden 11-0, Great Britain 14-0, and Switzerland 13-0 – finishing the Winter Olympics without surrendering a goal.  The Canadians were coached by Conn Smythe, later the principal owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and after whom the Conn Smythe Trophy, given to the MVP in the Stanley Cup playoffs, is named.  He is also remembered because one of the four NHL Divisions is named after him, the Smythe Division.

All the above save Curzan made it to the final, with McKeon and Zhang leading the prelims at 55.82 and Zhang the fastest semi-finalist at 55.89. Zhang also led out the final, followed by Huske, as Sjöström never factored for a medal. Mac Neil also seemed out of it at the turn, ahead of only Sjöström in seventh place, but she would finish the fastest, swimming 29.09 on the inward half, ahead of Zhang’s pace by almost a second, and it would bring Mac Neil the gold medal, 55.59 to 55.64 over Zhang. McKeon, who never really contended for gold, would edge out Huske by 1/100th for the bronze medal.
McKeon won her first individual medal of the Tokyo Olympics, but far from her last.

In addition, the divers were required to perform two dives drawn by lot, which were surprise dives disclosed to the contestants just before the competition so that they had no time to practice them.  There were six compulsory dives, four voluntary dives, and two drawn dives.  The required dives were as follows:  #6 - forward dive, hand on sides on entry, header forward, running takeoff; #13 - back dive with half-twist; #26 - forward running 1½ pike; #34 - inward somersault pike; #37 - reverse dive, layout position, standing takeoff, hands on side at entry (also known as an Auerbach or Isander); #46 - reverse dive, pike position, hands on side at entry.

They would face a challenge, however, from defending Olympic Champion Sa Jae-Hyeok of South Korea, although his best finish in a major international event since had been third at the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Asian Championships (the latter in the light-heavyweight category).
The field was whittled down before the event started, when Hysen Pulaku of Albania became the first participant of the Games to test positive for a banned substance and be removed from the festivities. Then Gevorg Davtyan of Armenia, 2008 Olympic bronze medalist, twice European Champion (2008, 2010) and once runner-up (2007), and 2010 World Champion and 2009 runner-up, failed the weigh-in and was withdrawn from the competition. Nearing the end of the snatch portion Sa, already in first place, tried to increase his lead with a lift of 162 kg, but dislocated his shoulder in the attempt and was unable to complete the event. Even a score of 158 kg would have been sufficient to remain in third place, but it would have been nowhere near the massive lifts of Lu Haojie and Lu Xiaojun, who had scored 170 and 175 kg respectively, and the latter of whom broke his own world record by 1 kilogram. There was confusion in the snatch with Lu Haojie waving his third attempt and Lu Xiaojun not realizing that his teammate had done so, thereby failing to appear for his third lift (which would have been an attempt at 177 kg).
Chatuphum Chinnawong of Thailand’s third-place lift of 157 kg meant that the Chinese competitors were essentially untouchable on the podium. Lu Haojie lifted 190 kg in his first attempt to take an early lead, and was followed in this feat by Iván Cambar of Cuba, winner of the event at the last two Pan American Games. Chinnawong moved into second place by lifting 191 kg while Lu Haojie, aiming to try that weight in his next attempt, was unable to continue after suffering a wrist injury on his previous lift. Lu Haojie would remain in contention, however, having posted one successful score in the clean and jerk. Cambar’s next lift was a successful 194 kg, returning to second place, although still eleven points behind Lu Haojie. Lu Xiaojun then arrived with an opening 195 kg lift, giving him a total of 370 points, which guaranteed him the gold medal, as he was ten points ahead of his injured compatriot and twenty-one ahead of Cambar. Chinnawong attempted to lift the same weight and enter the bronze medal position, but failed in both attempts and remained in fourth. Ibrahim Ramadan of Egypt followed with an attempt at 197 kg, which would have put him three points ahead of Cambar and onto the podium, but was unsuccessful and forced to make due with fifth place. Cambar did not even bother to take his final attempt, settling for bronze, while Lu Xiaojun used has last two turns to lift 204 kg and best his own world record for total points by one.

In the final, Annus led from the outset, with 80.53 (264-2½) in round one, and 82.32 (270-1) in round two. In the third round, he improved to 83.19 (272-11¼), the best mark of the competition. Murofushi was second throughout, getting his best mark of 82.91 (272-0¼) in the final round, seeming to win the silver medal. Annus then passed his drug tests both before and after the competition, but after the disqualification of Róbert Fazekas from the discus, his training partner with whom he shared a coach, he was called back for another test. Annus was back in Hungary and refused to return for another test. Analysis of his samples revealed that they came from two different people and he was disqualified, the gold medal reverting to Murofushi.
And the doping story of this event did not end there. In 2012 the IOC re-tested the drug samples from the 2004 Olympics. Tikhon’s sample was found to have the presence of a methendienone metabolite, an anabolic steroid. This was announced before the London 2012 Olympics and he was not allowed to compete, but in December 2012 he was disqualified from the 2004 Olympics and his silver medal removed. It has been decided that no further medals would be upgraded in this event and thus, as of June 2021, the only medal awarded in the 2004 hammer throw was Murofushi’s gold medal.

19002074,"Super-Heavyweight (>109 kilograms), Men",2020 Summer Olympics,61,Weightlifting,/editions/61/sports/WLF, 4 August 2021,"Tokyo International Forum, Yūrakuchō Business District (Marunouchi District), Tokyo, Japan",13 from 13 countries,Total of best lifts in snatch and clean & jerk determined placement.  Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"As was tradition, the heaviest men’s weight class was again contested as the last weightlifting event in Tokyo. The class was now for lifters over 109 kg bodyweight, the second highest in Olympic history after the 110 kg contested from 1972-92. Going into the final event of the Games, European lifters had not won a gold medal, which was the same scenario as Rio 2016.
As in Rio, it was down to the strongest men to change this, and once again that responsibility fell on the shoulders of the Georgian Lasha Talakhadze. In Rio he had support as the Europeans enjoyed a clean sweep of the medals but this time he was almost alone. Nevertheless, he was one of the safest gold medal bets of the Games. Talakhadze was unbeaten since Rio, and won three world and four European titles, and was also the world record holder with 264 kg in clean & jerk, 222 kg in snatch, and 485 kg in total, with the last two records achieved only in April 2021. The next best lifters in this weight class for the season were Gor Minasyan, silver medallist in the super-heavyweight class in Rio, and his compatriot Varazdat Lalayan. They finished second and third in the last European championships with 464 kg and 445 kg, respectively, but both had not been selected for Tokyo as the Armenian Weightlifting Federation was sanctioned due to the high number of doping offences. Also not present was Fernando Reis, qualification best 436 kg, as he had tested positive for doping shortly before going to Tokyo. So, the best qualified athletes at the Games after Talakhadze were Ali Davoudi, qualification best 441 kg, Man Asaad, season best 433 kg, Walid Bidani, qualification best 431 kg, and Hojamuhammet Toýçyýew, qualification best 427 kg. Unfortunately, Bidani was not able to participate as he was tested positive for COVID-19 on arrival in Japan and again one day before the competition.
Talakhadze was untouchable, and both in snatch and clean & jerk he started his attempts only when all the other competitors had already finished their lifts. Talakhadze gave a flawless performance, not missing any of his six attempts, and finally set world records in both techniques beating his own snatch, and clean & jerk records by 1 kg each and the total record by 3 kg. Silver was also a safe proposition for Davoudi, who lifted 200 kg and 241 kg for a total of 441 kg. Only the battle for bronze provided a brief challenge as Toýçyýew tried to lift 241 kg in his last attempt but failed, which secured bronze for Asaad.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 204 kg for snatch, 250 kg for clean & jerk, and 449 kg for total. Talakhadze bettered these records in five of his six lifts which meant that he set eight Olympic records, only his first clean & jerk attempt was not good enough.
Asaad’s bronze was the first ever Olympic weightlifting medal for Syria, while the fifth place of David Liti was the best ever Olympic weightlifting result for New Zealand.

The bronze medal went to Shuji Tsurumi, his only individual medal in Rome, but he would win two individual medals at Tokyo in 1964, one in this event and one on parallel bars. One surprise was that Yugoslav Slovenian Miroslav Cerar did not make the final, as he placed seventh in the all-around qualifying. He had been a bronze medalist in the event at the 1958 World Championships and would win Olympic gold on the pommelled horse in 1964 and 1968, and is often considered the greatest ever practitioner on this apparatus.

The tiebreaker for the Short Program was the Required Elements score, while the tiebreaker for the Free Skating was the Technical Merit score.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall for that section.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The tiebreakers were then 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  The placement for the  the Short Program was factored by 0.5 (33.3%), and the placement for Free Skating was factored by 1.0 (66.7%).  The sums of the factored placements were then used to determine final placement, with the Free Skating being the tiebreaker.",na,"Figure skating had always seen its share of controversy, with the judges’ scores often highly criticized and political maneuvers between national federations known to occur frequently. Often, skaters were placed not by how they skated but by their previous reputation, known as protocol judging. But the events surrounding the 1994 ladies’ event raised figure skating to a new low, or high, in the world of controversy.
The 1993 World Champion was Ukraine’s Oksana Bayul, but the 1991-94 European Champion had been France’s Surya Bonaly, a very athletic Black skater, who was often penalized by the judges for her lack of artistic impression. Among the American women, Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding had been 1-2 since the retirement of Kristi Yamaguchi after the 1992 Winter Olympics. But Kerrigan usually won, her artistry overcoming the athletic jumping ability of Harding, who was only the second woman ever to land a triple axel (after Midori Ito (JPN)). Harding also did not fit into the world of figure skating. She did not come from a wealthy family, and was definitely from the other side of the tracks. When she did not perform well, her mother yelled at her in front of the other families, loudly calling her a scum and a bitch. Tonya hunted and fished, was an accomplished auto mechanic, played pool, smoked cigarettes, and was completely outside the skating establishment.
Kerrigan was not wealthy either, but came from a background somewhat similar to Carol Heiss. Her family worked several jobs to allow her to compete in the expensive world of figure skating, and they re-mortgaged their home to help pay the travel and coaching expenses. Her small hometown of Stoneham, Massachusetts helped support her and the family by often chipping in for travel expenses. Beautiful, quiet, and classy, Kerrigan started to reap the rewards of the more traditional skating world, and received several commercial endorsements. This enabled her to become quite comfortable financially and erase her family’s economic concerns. Harding was getting none of this. Without Kerrigan’s looks and with Tonya’s background and baggage, no endorsements came her way.
Harding saw one way out. To get endorsements and money, she had to win the gold medal in Lillehammer and to her that meant eliminating Kerrigan as a competitor. Harding was then married to Jeff Gillooly. Gillooly contacted a friend, Shawn Eckardt, asking how a hit could be arranged on Kerrigan, disabling her for the Olympics. Eckardt eventually contacted Derrick Smith, who hired his nephew, Shane Stant, who agreed to attack Kerrigan and injure her leg. Gillooly did not know that Eckardt, Smith, and Stant tape recorded the conversation where the plan was hatched. The hit was supposed to take place on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where Kerrigan trained, but Stant was such an idiot that he could not find the ice rink, although it was known to virtually everybody. The group finally settled on attacking Kerrigan at the US Nationals in Detroit. Shortly before the competition, Kerrigan came off the ice after a training session, when a large man assaulted her with a solid-metal baton, hitting her just above the knee. The assailant was Stant, who escaped by running out of the arena to a getaway car. Kerrigan collapsed, crying out, “Why? Why me?” She could not skate at the Nationals.
Two days later, Tonya Harding won the US Nationals and qualified for the Olympic team. The US had only two spots for the ladies’ event in Lillehammer. The second spot could go to Michelle Kwan, who finished second to Harding. But the US figure skating authorities held the spot open for Kerrigan, if she could show that she could recover in time for the Winter Olympics. Kwan graciously stepped aside and Kerrigan did recover in time to be named to the Winter Olympic team.
Then the hunt started for the perpetrators of the crime. By late December, police had found Shawn Eckardt and the tape recording surfaced. Shane Stant turned himself in just before January 1994. In mid-January Harding was grilled by the FBI for 10½ hours and the next day, Gillooly was arrested. When it was obvious that Harding knew of the plot, and had in fact approved of it, the USOC planned to toss her off the Olympic team. But Harding lawyered up, threatened a huge lawsuit if that was done, and the USOC capitulated.
So in Lillehammer the competition was surrounded by a media frenzy probably not seen before at any Olympic Games. In the United States the publicity around the event led to the highest television ratings in years for any American program. The short program began on 23 February. Almost lost amidst all the furor was the return of Katarina Witt, the 1984-88 gold medalist, now eligible again as professionals were allowed in Olympic figure skating. Witt was the first big name to skate in the short program, and she performed well, after being out of international competition for six years, eventually placing sixth in the short.
Harding came out next among the favorites and US sportswriter Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post described her appearance, “She had on so much makeup, it looked like she rear-ended a Mary Kay Cadillac. I half expected her to skate over and take my drink order.” Harding’s medal chances were over almost immediately, as she made numerous errors in the short program, and placed only 10th.
The competition would now come down to the three favorites – Kerrigan, Bayul, and Bonaly. They placed 1-2-3 in the short program, in that order, and if any of them could win the free skate, they would win the gold medal. The next day, the soap opera went on in training when Bayul collided with Tanja Szewczenko (GER), while they shared the ice. Bayul’s leg was cut and she needed stitches, but would be able to compete the next night.
In the free skate Harding was an early starter because of her placement in the short program. She barely made it onto the ice in time to avoid disqualification, skated about 45 seconds rather slovenly, then skated over to the judges, starting crying and asked to start again – her bootlace was torn. She was allowed to re-start, would place seventh in the free skate, and eighth overall. This episode was later re-enacted in a famous Seinfeld episode.
Kerrigan skated next, first up among the leaders and produced a nearly flawless performance. The gold medal seemed to be hers. But then Bayul skated a similar performance, and the judges ranked her first, five votes to four, although things could change depending on Bonaly’s performance. Bonaly was the last skater but slipped to fourth place, the bronze medal going to China’s Lu Chen. After Bonaly skated the results were final, and Bayul had the gold medal over Kerrigan by the narrowest of margins. Had any of four judges given Kerrigan 1/10th more, or Bayul 1/10th less, for any score, the gold medal would have gone to Kerrigan.
Bringing some sanity to the proceedings was the final skater, Katarina Witt. Witt had won her first gold medal in Sarajevo, which was now a shattered city, destroyed by the Serbian ethnic cleansing. Witt skated to Where Have All the Flowers Gone? in memory of her adopted city. She placed seventh overall, a lovely reminder of a better time in figure skating.
After the Winter Olympics, Harding pled guilty, copping a plea to conspiring to hinder prosecution of a case. She had to perform 500 hours of community service, and paid a $100,000 fine. She and Jeff Gillooly eventually divorced. She was banned for life by the US Figure Skating Association, and her 1994 US title stripped. Needing to support herself, she later became a professional boxer.
Bayul turned professional and did very well for herself in ice shows, moving to the United States. With her new-found riches came some difficulties with alcohol, including an episode in January 1997 when she was charged with drunken driving in Connecticut, while traveling over 100 miles/hour (160 km/hour). She later claimed that she did not mean to go that fast but had lost control because she was so entranced by a Madonna song she was listening to.
Kerrigan married her agent, Jerry Solomon. She had some controversy after Lillehammer, appearing at Disney World with Mickey Mouse, where she was heard to say, “This is most corny thing I’ve ever done.” She later hosted Saturday Night Live, where she jokingly referred to that incident, saying what she actually said was, “This is most horny thing I’ve ever done.” She skated in a few ice shows, but mainly raised her family in Massachusetts.
It is said that reality is stranger than fiction. This story could not have been made up.

All favorites went through to the semi-finals, but the second semi-final heat saw the exit of Wang.

After her title, Zhou was naturally ecstatic, and in an interview with Chinese television, she thanked her parents, who had supported her sports dreams, despite their poverty. While this would not have caused raised eyebrows in most of the world, it caused a stir in China, where athletes generally thank their country. IOC member Yu Zaiqing was quoted as saying: )It’s fine to thank your mom and dad [for the gold medal] but one needs to thank the country first and foremost), referring to the country’s government funded sports system. But Yu’s comment received a lot of criticism in China, notably from the younger internet generation, who preferred Zhou’s more natural and enthusiastic response.

VCB was back and at the 2011 Worlds, she had defeated Felix, who placed third in Daegu. Also considered contenders for medals were VCB’s teammate Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, already the Olympic 100 gold medalist in London, and Felix’s teammate, Carmelita Jeter, runner-up in the 200 at the 2011 Worlds, and runner-up to Fraser-Pryce in the 100 four days earlier. Another long shot for a medal was Sanya Richards-Ross, more highly considered as a 400 runner, and the London 400 gold medalist three days before this final.
In the end form would hold as it would come down to those five placing 1-5, with Felix finally getting her Olympic gold medal. She started fast, closing the stagger on her outer lane by 75 metres, Ivorian sprinter Murielle Ahouré, and led at the 100, narrowly ahead of Jeter. But on the final straight, her form was perfect and she floated to the line, simply increasing her lead over the final metres to win by 0.21 over Fraser-Pryce, with Jeter winning bronze. VCB was out of the medals this time, with Richards-Ross in fifth. Felix would eventually win three gold medals in London, adding golds in both relay events.

Six of seven races in the giant slalom World Cup season had been held with Hölzl in the lead after two wins in Aspen and Lienz. Zettel was second with a win in Maribor and Maze was third. Poutiainen, the 2008-09 giant slalom World Cup winner and silver medalist from Torino in 2006, won the first race of the winter in Sölden and also the last World Cup race in Cortina about one month before the Olympics, while Tessa Worley won in Åre. Hölzl was also the reigning world champion from Val d’Isère in 2009 where Maze took silver and Poutiainen bronze. Also competing was Julia Mancuso, the gold medalist from Torino, who had already won two silver medals at this Games in downhill and Super Combined, but the bronze medalist from Torino, Anna Ottosson, had retired in 2007. Also absent was the 2006-07 giant slalom World Cup winner, 2007 world champion, and fourth-place finisher in Torino, Nicole Hosp, who sustained an ACL tear in her right knee on 24 October 2009 after a fall in the first race of the season in Sölden.
With fog covering the majority of the upper part of the course, and a large field, the organizers decided to start the skiers on the first run at shorter intervals than would normally be expected. Kathrin Zettel, with a time of 1:58.28, set the early pace, which was then beaten four skiers later by Taina Barioz by 0.14 seconds. Barioz held the lead until the 16th skier down, Elisabeth Görgl, who took the lead by 0.02 seconds. The next racer, downhill winner Lindsey Vonn, caught an edge in the snow and crashed out of the course. Unfortunately the defending champion, Julia Mancuso, had already started her run when Vonn crashed, so she had to stop around a third of the way down the course. Having to start her run later, and in poorer conditions, a distraught Mancuso could only finish 1.30 seconds behind Görgl in 18th place, effectively ending her chance.
However the drama didn’t end there. Deteriorating weather conditions first delayed the start of the second run, then caused its postponement to the following day, the first time this had happened since 1980, when the event was then scheduled over 2 days.
Weather also affected the second run, particularly the later starters. A brave performance by Mancuso, with what was to be the third fastest time of 1:11.24 in the second run, gave her a combined time of 2:27.66, temporarily putting her into the lead and eventually placing her eighth overall. Her lead held for some time until Fabienne Suter bettered this time with a combined total of 2:27.52. With six of the top ranked skiers to go, Viktoria Rebensburg produced a good run to give her the lead with 2:27.11. Tina Maze, following immediately afterwards, appeared set to take the lead for much of the course, but fell just 0.04 seconds short at the end to move into second place. The overnight leader, Elisabeth Görgl, briefly threatened Rebensburg’s time, but finished 0.14 seconds behind to take the bronze medal. The fastest time of the second run belonged to Denise Karbon, the 2007-08 giant slalom World Cup winner, in a time of 1:11.15, but a poor first run left her down in 23rd place.
Among the favorites, only Maze won a medal with silver. The other medalists were surprises. The 20-year-old Rebensburg had never won a World Cup race before, but had won the Super G in 2008 and 2009, as well as the giant slalom in 2009 at the World Junior Championships. Görgl had only made the team the day before when she bumped out Super G Olympic champion Andrea Fischbacher in an Austrian team qualifier. Rebensburg also won the first medal for ski manufacturer Nordica, while Maze won silver with Stöckli, and Görgl bronze on Head skis. Of note in this event is also Cynthia Denzler, Colombia’s first ever competitor in a Winter Games – sadly she did not finish her first run. However she was to have better luck in the slalom a few days later when she finished 51st.

Schäfer had taken over as the world’s leading male figure skater, winning all European titles since 1929 and world titles since 1930.
At the 1932 European Championships in Paris mid-January, he was far ahead of his nearest rivals.
Grafström made a mistake in his specialty, the compulsory figures, and Schäfer won his first Olympic gold with a clear margin. The Swedish stylist was able to recover from his mistake and secured the silver, ending his Olympic career with three gold and one silver, a medal collection even Sonja Henie was unable to match. Montgomery Wilson improved from his modest 13th place in St. Moritz to win Canada’s first ever figure skating Olympic medal, securing the bronze medal. One week later Wilson won the silver medal in the World Championships in Montreal behind Schäfer, but by then Grafström had left for Europe, ending one of the greatest and longest figure skating careers of all time. He had competed in the World Championships first in 1914 in Helsinki, and further international titles were denied him because, from 1915-1921, no figure skating championships were held due to World War I.

Her biggest challengers were expected to be the defending champion, Soviet Nataliya Petrusyova, who held the world record of 1:19.31, set at Medeo in 1983, and was the 1982 World Sprint champion, and Enke’s East German teammate, Andrea Schöne, who had won the 1983 World Championships and was second to Enke in both 1982 and 1984.
The 500 champion, Christa Rothenburger, started in the first pair and posted an Olympic record 1:23.98. Schöne was in the second pair, and although she started slowly, she was well ahead of Rothenburger at 600 metres, and finished in 1:22.83 to take the lead. Enke was in the next pairing. She had the fastest start of the event and held on to it, crossing the line in 1:21.61, which would win her the gold medal. Petrusyova was in the sixth group but her time of 1:23.21 would be good only for bronze. One other medal favorite was Nataliya Glebova, who started very well, but fell at 150 metres.

The United States and Brazil were added from the results of the 1967 Pan-American Games, joined by host nation Mexico, which had no volleyball tradition.
The two top teams were the gold and silver medalists from 1964, the USSR and Czechoslovakia. The Soviets had won the 1967 Europeans but Czechoslovakia was World Champion in 1966. Although the sport had been invented in the United States, the US was not considered in the same league as the top European powers.

In the final match, the USSR played Czechoslovakia, both teams tied with records of 7-1, but the Soviets won in straights, 7, 4, and 8.
The Soviet Union was quite fortunate. It had not been playing well of late, and had recently lost three matches to the GDR (East Germany). In their Olympic match against East Germany, the Soviet team bus was stuck in traffic and they were 90 minutes late for the match.

He collapsed into the water, earned only a total score of 6.30 for the dive, dropping him back to fifth place, and it was not certain he could continue.

He moved up further on the final dive, placing third in qualifying, with Tan placing first. Tan had played Alydar to Louganis’s Affirmed over the years, but he had beaten him twice earlier in 1988 and was looking for gold in Seoul.
But it was not to be. Louganis led most of the finals, except after the fourth dive, when he briefly dropped behind with a poor dive. But he regained the lead after round five, and held it for the gold medal, winning by almost 26 points. His ninth dive was a reprise of his reverse 2½ pike which he performed well, scoring 8.5s from all judges. Tan had to settle for a silver medal repeat, and in 1992 he would three-peat with a third silver on springboard. Tan also won silver on springboard at the 1986 and 1991 World Championships, having the poor timing to compete in the same era as Greg Louganis.
More drama occurred over the next few years. In 1995, Louganis came out as gay, which had been suspected, and also revealed that he was HIV-positive, and had been so at the time of the Seoul Olympics. Only a few people knew this at the time, including his coach, Ron O’Brien, but Dr. James Puffer did not. Louganis had been concerned that his head injury in Seoul had possibly contaminated the water and risked infecting other divers, although the dilution by the water, and the chlorine in the water, obviated that possibility. Both O’Brien and Puffer tested negative for HIV.
A few days later, Louganis would win the platform gold medal, completing the diving double-double, to replicate the feat of Pat McCormick from 1952-56.

But at the Trials, only two inches separated Fuchs, O’Brien, and Hooper, so an American sweep was considered likely. O’Brien opened the final with 17.41 (57-1½) and this would be good enough for the gold medal. In the final round, Hooper put a scare into him, with 17.39 (57-0¾) but had to settle for silver. Fuchs second consecutive bronze medal gave the US another sweep in the shot put – it’s sixth one.

Douillet and Ogawa met in the Pool A final, with Douillet winning a close match only by shido.

Away from the Finn the picture was not so clear as the expected challengers from Norway, Austria and East Germany had faltered on the smaller hill and others, notably Pavel Ploc and his Czechoslovak teammates, had excelled where the more favoured failed. 
Strong winds meant that the competition had to be postponed on four occasions but when it was eventually held Nykänen’s first jump of 120.5 m was the longest ever recorded in Olympic competition and virtually ensured that he would win the gold medal. The strong Norwegian tradition was upheld by Erik Johnsen who finished second a week after placing 41st in on the normal hill. Just 0.2 of a point behind Johnsen was Matjaž Debelak, the first Yugoslav ski jumper to win an Olympic title.
Dead last was the eccentric Briton Eddie “The Eagle” Edwards who narrowly avoided the embarrassment of scoring half the points of the penultimate finisher. It needs to be pointed out though that the next-to-last jumper, Todd Gillman of Canada, had fallen on his second jump.
The stories of Eddie Edwards and Matti Nykänen have come together and moved apart over the decades. The fame gained by their Olympic appearances was exploited to the point where both men reached the top of the Finnish pop charts but financial problems were to haunt them throughout the nineties. This is where the stories part company. Eddie Edwards recovered from bankruptcy, became a qualified lawyer and shares his time between the law, the building industry, his wife and children and the celebrity circuit. Nykänen’s life spiraled into alcoholism and violence and in 2004 he was convicted of assault when he stabbed a friend after an argument over a finger pulling competition. Married five times Nykänen has also served prison time for domestic violence and at one point was reduced to working as a stripper.

While Konakbayev had a trouble free progression through the rounds, Oliva was lucky to survive a meeting with Ace Rusevski of Yugoslavia in the last eight. With two judges splitting their votes, the Italian only progressed when the fifth judge, who had the fight even, gave him his preferential vote. Despite being roared on by a partisan Muscovite crowd, on this occasion Konakbayev was unable to figure out the awkward style of the Italian bank clerk. Oliva was declared champion on a 4-1 split decision of the judges with the dissenting vote coming from the Bulgarian judge. As the verdict was declared the Italian slumped to his knees and started weeping. He was awarded the Val Barker Trophy for best boxer of the tournament on the strength of his performances. Konabakyev continued his winning ways as an amateur and retained both his European and World Cup title. As Soviet champion he may well have been picked for the 1984 Olympic if not for the Communist boycott.

Among their numerous protests, the Americans argued about the fact that there was no pit or hole in which to plant the pole and also that there was no sandpit or bales of straw to break the competitors falls.  This protest was understandable as the organizers were definitely behind the times in these matters as these facilities had been provided at the two previous Olympic Games.

Only Germany, the reigning World Champions, had earned medals in each of the last three years, as it had been a bronze medalist in 2001 and 2002. Australia, meanwhile, had been World Champion in 2001 and runner-up in 2002, while the United States had won in 2002 and Canada was the 2003 third-place finisher. Canada’s Western Rowing Club & Victoria City Rowing Club had also taken the Remenham Challenge Cup at the 2003 Henley Royal Regatta.
The Americans won their heat in the opening round in Olympic record time, defeating both Romania and Australia in the process, while the Dutch, who had not seen the podium in this event at the World Championships since 1995, took the other heat. In the final, however, Romania mustered its strength reserves and captured the gold medal by a margin of nearly two seconds, after having gone neck and neck against the Americans for much of the race. The United States, meanwhile, nearly lost its silver medal to a strong drive from the Dutch crew, who came on strong in the final section of the course and missed second place by only 0.29 seconds, settling instead for bronze. Two members of the Romanian crew, Georgeta Andrunache and Viorica Susanu, had won the coxless pairs event earlier in the Games, while Elisabeta Lipă won her record eighth gold medal, at the age of nearly 40, five of which had been gold, including her first in the double sculls from 1984.

Britain’s 2019 world champion Joe Fraser qualified in seventh place. The 2017 and 2018 world champion Zou Jingyuan’s 16.166 was the highest score by any gymnast in all qualifying events, and was looking to make amends for an error at the 2019 Worlds that prevented him reaching the final of his best event. He was, however, the favourite for gold in Tokyo. The 2016 Rio bronze medallist David Belyavsky of ROC qualified for the final in ninth position and was hoping to add a second consecutive medal.
Turkey’s Ferhat Arıcan was on the bars first and his routine scored him 15.633 and he laid down the challenge to Zou. The Chinese gymnast bettered his qualifying score, however, scoring a massive 16.233 points and taking a big lead. Zou’s team-mate You Hao moved into the bronze medal position with a 15.633. With one final gymnast to perform, the second ranked qualifier, Lukas Dauser of Germany, it looked like another 1-2 for China, but the German had something to say about that and his 15.700 saw him move into the silver medal spot, which relegated You to fourth.
Ferhat Arican’s bronze medal was the first ever won by a Turkish gymnast in Olympic competition, while Zou Jingyuan’s 16.233 points was the most by any gymnast, male or female, at the Tokyo Games.

The competition started on the polo field and golf course at the Riviera Country Club, with the cross-country ride being held near Inglewood, California, and the jumping held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The scoring was heavily weighted towards the endurance phase, with 400 points possible in the dressage, 1,300 in the steeplechase and cross-country, and 300 in the jumping, for a possible total of 2,000 points.
American Harry Chamberlin took the lead in the dressage followed by his teammate Eddie Argo, with Pahud de Mortanges placed third. The cross-country and steeplechase phase was won by American Earl Thomson, and moved into the overall lead, with Pahud de Mortanges second in jumping and also overall. Chamberlin was far back in this phase, and Argo even further behind. Argo came back to win the jumping phase quite comfortably, with only a minor time penalty, but Pahud de Mortanges placed second in jumping to defend his gold medal. Thomson struggled in the jumping but held on for the silver medal, with the bronze going to Pahud de Mortanges’ teammate Clarence von Rosen, Jr.. Thomson would return in 1936 and again win the silver medal in the individual 3-day event.
Pahud de Mortanges had an interesting life. In 1938 he sustained a serious wrist injury, almost causing his hand to be amputated, which ended his riding career. In 1942 he was taken as a prisoner-of-war but escaped in 1943 by jumping out of a train and travelling to Gibraltar. He took part in the Normandy landings as a major, and was later made Chief of H. M. Military House from 1954-62. He was also President of the Dutch NOC in 1946-51 and 1959-64.

The favourite was the Dane, Karen Margrethe Harup, who had won the event at the 1947 European Championships. Harup proved to be a worthy champion as she broke the Olympic record in all three of her races. She finished over a second clear of Suzanne Zimmerman  of the USA with Judy-Joy Davies  taking bronze for Australia.

France’s Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, however, winner of the past two editions of the World Championships and also the 2021 European Champion, was much more favored. Jolanda Neff of Switzerland, meanwhile, had won the test event. The qualification for the event was completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus was not impacted by the delay of the Tokyo Games.
Ferrand-Prévot slid out early in the race to give Neff a lead that she never relinquished. Great Britain’s Evie Richards, the 2018 Commonwealth Games runner-up, looked to be in contention early on, but she was soon replaced in the lead pack by Neff’s compatriots Sina Frei and Linda Indergand. The three Swiss riders soon pulled ahead of all other competitors and captured all three medals by a comfortable margin.
This was Switzerland’s first podium sweep since the 1936 Berlin Games, when they captured all of the medals in the floor exercise, although in that case bronze was shared by a German competitor. Switzerland’s only other clean sweep had come in 1924, in the pommeled horse, when the nation had taken the top four spots. As for cycling sweeps, this had only occurred previously at the 1904 St. Louis Olympics, in many of the odd, US-dominated races, and the 1906 Intercalated Games, when France captured the podium in the road race.

It was surprising because her PR coming into London was only 4:33.55 from October 2011 and she had improved dramatically within the last year.
The final saw the lead exchanged several times with Hungarian Katinka Hosszú leading on the butterfly and backstroke legs, but Beisel took over on the breaststroke, only to see Ye pass her just before the final stroke change. The final freestyle was all Ye, who came home in 58.68, with the final 50 done in a stunning 28.93, for a world record 4:28.43. This was the first individual world record since the skinsuit era, and was over a second better than Rice’s world record set in winning this event in Beijing. Beisel took silver, while Ye’s teammate Li Xuanxu came home for the bronze, Hosszú finishing fourth, with Rice back in a tie for fourth with American Caitlin Leverenz.
Ye’s victory was not without some controversy, as her finish was stunning, but some thought it was “too good”. In his 400 IM gold medal on the same night, Ryan Lochte had finished in only 58.65 for the final 100, and Ye actually outswam him on the final 50, as he posted 29.10. Several American coaches and officials openly said that Ye’s mark had to be performance enhanced, though she passed all her drug tests, and the IOC actually had to come to Ye’s defense in a press release.

In that round Petkov and Nystrom drew, as did Nystrom and Dubicki, which meant that Kolesov’s victory by decision over Dubicki was the determining factor to give Kolesov the gold medal. Petkov won the silver medal over Nystrom based on lower bodyweight. Kolesov was World Champion in 1962-63 and would win again in 1965.

He came to Rio as the favorite but left in tears. After 5.85 only three vaulters remained, Lavillenie, American Sam Kendricks, and Brazil’s Thiago Braz. Kendricks went out at 5.93, taking bronze. Lavillenie was clear through 5.98 and seemed in control, with Braz clearing 5.93 and then passing 5.98. At 6.03 Braz cleared on his second attempt, as Lavillenie missed twice. Needing a better height for the gold medal, as he trailed on misses, Lavillenie took his final attempt at 6.08 but it was not much of an effort. Braz had won gold in a huge upset, as Lavillenie took silver, with the Brazilian exulting in the victory.
The Brazilian crowd had been biased in their support of Braz, but they also booed and jeered Lavillenie whenever he appeared on the runway. The Frenchman was moved to tears, and Braz had to apologize when, the next day on the podium, the Brazilian crowd again booed Lavillenie. He was comforted under the stands by Braz and Ukrainian vault legend Sergey Bubka, but Lavillenie would have no good memories from the 2016 Olympics.

The event was put on the program in an attempt to have the throwers imitate the classic poses seen by discus throwers on ancient Greek amphora.  Unfortunately, almost nobody understood exactly what poses they were required to make during their throw.  The rules read as follows:
a)  For this test a pedestal 80 centimetres long and 70 centimetres broad is inclined, with a maximum height of 15 centimetres behind and a minimum height of 5 centimetres in front.
   b)  The Hellenic method of throwing the discus is something like the following:
The thrower places himself on the pedestal with the feet apart, and holding the discus in either hand. He then takes it with both hands slightly stretched, lifting them without letting go the discus, and stretching out the rest of his body in the same way in the same direction.  After that he turns the trunk slightly to the right and bends sharply, so as to bring the left hand when free to the right knee, and the right hand still holding the discus, as far back as the build of the shoulder permits.  At this moment, the right foot should be forward and the legs bent; the right foot rests on the sole, and the left on the toes only.  Then by a sharp and simultaneous extension of the whole body, the thrower throws the discus straight in front of him.
The Greek judges ended up being a bit lenient and Verner Järvinen won the event over Nikolaos Georgantas.  This rather upset Georgantas, who did not think Järvinen’s style was legal.  After the decision was announced, the Greek walked over to the pedestal and let fly in an unhampered manner, far outdistancing all other throws.  Matin Sheridan was probably hampered by his efforts to compete concurrently in the standing high jump.

Nevertheless she competed, finishing 19th in the qualification heats, and then advancing to the final via the elimination rounds, albeit as a fastest loser from the semi-finals. The fastest qualifier was Marit Bjørgen (NOR) who had been favored to win gold medals at Torino in 2006 but had ended up with none. Here she qualified for the final, winning her elimination round heats with relative ease. The final itself started as a close contest between Bjørgen and Justyna Kowalczyk (POL) with Bjørgen pulling away in the last quarter of the course to finally win her first Olympic gold medal. A remarkable race by Majdič saw her win the bronze medal from Anna Dahlberg-Olsson (SWE), although Majdič was in such pain that she had difficulty walking after the race. This was the first ever medal for Slovenia in cross-country skiing. The 2009 World Sprint Champion, Arianna Follis of Italy, was in Vancouver but did not contest this event, as she specializes in freestyle and the sprint was held classically.

Switzerland and Great Britain, the 2012 and 2013 world champions respectively, were ranked second and third. Sweden’s skip was Margaretha Sigfridsson, four-time world runner-up (2002, 2009, 2012, 2013), while Switzerland sent Mirjam Ott, to her fourth Olympics. Ott was the 2012 World Champion, as well as the 2002 and 2006 Olympic runner-up. Great Britain was headed by Scotland’s Eve Muirhead, the reigning world champion and 2010 runner-up. She too was a veteran of the 2010 Winter Olympics, but had finished seventh among ten nations. Never to be underestimated was Canada who, despite being ranked fourth and not having won Olympic gold since the sport’s debut in 1998, was represented by Jennifer Jones, a household name in the country. Jones was not a rookie on the international scene – she was the 2008 World Champion – but she was much better known for her success at the Canadian national championships: four-times champion (2005, 2008-2010), thrice runner-up (2006, 2011, 2013), and twice bronze-medalist (2007 and 2012). Almost as well-known nationally was Jill Officer, who had been Jones’ second for over a decade and shared in all of her friend’s successes. Another notable skip was Kim Ji-sun, who headed South Korea’s first delegation to Olympic curling.
If the world had not heard of the Canadian team prior to the 2014 Olympics, then it certainly knew their names after: Canada’s Jones became the first female skip to lead her rink through Olympic round robin play undefeated, a suitable follow-up to Kevin Martin’s similar achievement for the Canadian men in 2010. Sigfridsson was not far behind, however, finishing 7-2, while Ott and Muirhead ended with a record of 5-4 each, sufficient to take them to the medal round despite surprising challenges from China and Japan. Notable in this portion of the tournament was the Great Britain-United States match, where Muirhead set an Olympic record by scoring seven points in a single end against Erika Brown’s rink.
Jones, having revealed herself as a significant threat, defeated Murihead in the semifinals, despite a valiant effort that saw the latter nearly recover from an early 3-0 deficit, while Sigfridsson vanquished Ott. The bronze medal game was close throughout, with Ott able to force Muirhead into a tenth end, but Great Britain emerged victorious. This made them the youngest rink to win an Olympic medal, beating China’s bronze medal-winning team by nearly two years. In the final, Canada and Sweden were neck and neck at the end of the fifth end, when Jones decided to blank the sixth and seventh ends to obtain last rock in the eighth. There she scored only one point, bringing Canada into the ninth with a score of 4-3, but her rink’s excellent shooting earned them two points that clinched their victory. Jones’ rink joined Martin’s as undefeated in Olympic tournament play, the first woman to achieve this feat. The achievements of Canada’s women would only be boosted later in the day, when their hockey team took gold and made the nation Olympic champions in both of its national winter sports.

The USA had slowly begun to regroup and a gap of 9 seconds between the Australians and Americans in 2001 had shrunk to just over a second at the 2003 World Championships.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Britain was represented by its reigning World Championship crew, Annie Vernon, Debbie Flood, Frances Houghton, Katherine Grainger, all of whom except Vernon were previous Olympic medalists in various disciplines.

Great Britain and Germany were placed in the same heat in the opening round, with the former coming out on top with a margin of over a second and a half. The fastest finish, however, went to China, who crew included three members from their 2007 World bronze medal-winning squad, Tang Bin, Jin Ziwei, and Xi Aihua, augmented by Zhang Yangyang. China maintained its strength through the final and, to the surprise of many, unleashed a massive drive near the end of the race and passed the Britons, who had been leading the entire time, to steal the gold medal, its first ever in Olympic rowing. Thus Great Britain had to settle once again for silver, while the Germans lost an Olympic final for the first time and took home bronze instead.

Friesinger’s rink record of 1:58.66 was first broken by Annette Gerritsen, followed by Nao Kodaira and Margot Boer, the latter setting it to 1:58.10. Then it was Ireen Wüst’s turn, the 3,000 m champion of the Torino Games.

Ouellette was a corporal in the Canadian Reserve Army and also worked full-time as a tool designer at the Ford plant in Windsor, Ontario. One of his main competitors was his teammate, Gil Boa, who had won the 1954 World Championships in this event. In practice in Melbourne, Ouellette was unhappy with his rifle, and he and Boa decided to share the same rifle. This meant that they had to shoot very quickly as there was a time limit to fire the required 60 rounds. Boa shot first and scored 598, dropping a point in his first and last strings. He was bettered by Vasily Borisov (URS), who recorded a 599. With little time to spare, Ouellette fired off 60 shots, almost in rapid-fire fashion, and scored a perfect 600. At first considered a world record, the course was re-measured and found to be 1.5 metres short of 50 metres, thus disqualifying the mark as a record. Ouellette would compete in the Olympics again, but not until 1968. The Americans did not fare well, but noted that nearly everyone in the event used the new U.S. ammunition that had just been developed, Western Supermatch Mark III.

Canada was fourth after round one, but moved up in round two and tied the United States with 20 faults, as Switzerland dropped back and would settle for the bronze medal. This was the second time that the team jumping required a jump-off at the Olympics, the first time occurring in 2004. The first three American riders – McLain Ward, Laura Kraut, and Will Simpson – went clear, giving the US a team score of 0.00 for the jump-off. Canada had only three riders, after Mac Cone’s horse Ole was injured and could not compete. When Canadian Jill Henselwood missed an obstacle, the gold medal went to the United States. Canada was led by Ian Millar, who was competing in his ninth Olympics, which tied the Olympic best held by Austrian sailor Hubert Raudaschl. This was Millar’s first medal, and he would return in 2012 and compete at his 10th Olympic Games, a record.
Switzerland won the bronze medal, as noted, but originally Norway had finished ahead of them. However, Norway was disqualified when Tony André Hansen’s horse Camiro tested positive for capsaicin, a topical anti-inflammatory medication often applied to horses’ legs so they do not hurt when they hit obstacles. Without his scores, Norway dropped to eighth place. Germany was also affected by drug controls when Christian Ahlmann’s horse, Cöster, also tested positive for capsaicin. Two years later another German, Marco Kutscher, would be disqualified for a positive doping test in the event, which meant that Germany did not officially have three riders finish the course in either round, although they had originally tied the Netherlands for fourth place.

The Ordinal Placement for each judge was based on Total Points awarded by that judge to the pairs, with the tiebreaker being Sporting Merit (2nd mark).

Thus, if a pair were ranked first by a majority of the judges, that pair was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.  If no absolute majority for a place existed, the tiebreakers were, in order: 1) Total Ordinals, 2) Total Points, 3) Compulsory Figure Points.",na,"At the World Figure Skating Championships in Oslo 1954, the Canadian couple from Toronto, Frances Dafoe and Norris Bowden, emerged as the new star couple in pair skating. After coming 5th in the 1952 Olympics, they developed their program to include new elements as twist lifts, throw jumps and overhead Lasso lifts. They defended their World title in 1955, this time in an extremely close contest with a pair which represented the European “classical style”, Sissy Schwartz and Kurt Oppelt from Vienna. Schwartz/Oppelt showed excellent form two weeks before the 1956 Olympics by winning the European title in Paris with a very impressive program.
The pair skating event in Cortina 1956 turned out to be a very controversial competition. It started after the performance of the young German couple, Marika Kilius (only 12) and Franz Ningel (19). The audience was very dissatisfied with the judges and started to throw oranges and other items into the ice. The competition had to be stopped for 45 minutes to calm down the audience and clean the ice.
In a very close contest, Schwartz/Oppelt won the gold medal with the scantest possible margin. Their Canadian rivals Dafoe/Bowden made an outstanding program, but faltered on a lift, causing them to finish after their music ended. The Nagy siblings from Hungary, Marianna and László, repeated their placing form Oslo 1952, winning another Olympic bronze medal.
European critics claimed that the Canadian pair’s overhead lifts was not covered in the rules and accordingly not permitted, but this view was strongly opposed by the North Americans. The discussions continued after the World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen one week later, which ended with another close victory for the Austrian couple. Five out of nine judges had Schwartz/Oppelt in first place, the remaining four went for Dafoe/Bowden. This turned out to be the final international championship participation for both pairs involved in the controversy.
The controversy was finally settled in 1959, when a revision of the rules for pair skating was accepted by the ISU Congress.

Since his Torino championship, Davis had continued to dominate this distance. In 2007 and 2008 he had won the world title, and in 2008 and 2009 claimed the 1,000 m World Cup. On 7 March 2009, Davis became the first man to beat 1:07 in the event, lowering the world record considerably to 1:06.42. And Davis had been quite untouchable during the running season as well, winning each of the four World Cup races contested prior to the Games. Davis’s status of a favourite was even further increased by the fact that the other skaters behind him had not performed consistently, and the podium was essentially open to about 10 skaters.
Shani Davis also enjoyed the advantage of having drawn the last pair, and could watch his opponents prior to taking the ice himself. When he did, the fastest time had been set by Mo Tae-Beom, the surprising winner of the 500 m. The Korean had posted the fastest splits of the race in his duel with Chad Hedrick. As usual, the 2006 5,000 m champion, posted a strong final lap, but Mo held on to win in 1:09.12, two tenths ahead of Hedrick. While not known for his quick openers, Davis trailed Mo’s early splits by less than three tenths, then pulled away in the final 400 m to win in 1:08.94. This made Davis the first repeat winner of the men’s 1,000 m.

The remaining four places were earned at the 1986 World Championships (Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Norway) and the 1987 B World Championships (Yugoslavia).
The South Koreans had been in preparation for the tournament for years, training under isolated, Spartan conditions. This had not yet resulted in fame at the 1986 Worlds (12th), but paid off at the Olympics. They started off with a win against Czechoslovakia, but subsequently lost to Yugoslavia. Their win against the US secured Korea’s spot in the final pool, but they would carry their lost match into the final pool. In the other group, Norway and the USSR easily held off China and Ivory Coast, and drew 19-19 to both qualify for the next round.
In that tense final group, the Soviets first defeated Yugoslavia, while Korea beat Norway. This meant three teams were still in a position to win the gold, and even Norway could still claim the silver medal. The Norwegian women pulled away from Yugoslavia 20-15, meaning they had secured at least a bronze. The unofficial final match between South Korea and the USSR was sold out, filled with enthusiastic Korean supporters. The agile Koreans pulled up to a 16-12 lead, but saw it disappear as the Soviets scored five times in a row to take the lead, 17-16. In a last-ditch effort, the hosts managed to come back in to the game, winning it 21-19 in front of an ecstatic crowd. The Soviet women fell back to third, as the Norwegian team claimed its first Olympic medal in the sport.

Takahashi’s chances ended when he fell attempting a quadruple jump in an otherwise well presented free skate. Skating last, Plyushchenko had a couple of minor errors, and a tense wait followed while the judges marked his performance. In the end Lysacek won the gold from Plyushchenko by 1.31 points. A disappointed Plyushchenko was quick to make reference to what he perceived as poor judging, noting Lysacek didn’t include a quadruple jump in his program, as he had, but the result stood.

Carl ran the last bend in third place, but had the outside lane and pushed past the opposition. She had the most reserves in the final sprint and was the first to cross the line. It was also a birthday present for their coach Peter Schlickenrieder, who won silver at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games exactly 20 years ago, and turned 52 on the day of the Beijing event. Finland with Krista Pärmäkoski dropped back on the last climb, after making most of the leader’s work.

Italy was also thought to have a shot at a medal, skiing on their home snow, after placing third at the Worlds in 2001 and 2005. But the opening leg was a shocker as the lead was taken by Japan, with Finland second, and Norway third, while Italy and Russia were back in seventh and ninth place, respectively. On the second leg, Japan dropped back to 10th place, and the leaders moved up, with Finland, Norway, Germany, and Italy in the first four places, in that order. Russia was still only eighth. Russia’s third leg was skied by Yuliya Chepalova, who posted the fastest leg of the event to move her team up to fourth, with the top five places at the anchor exchange as follows: Germany, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and Italy. The final leg was a surprise. Norway had Marit Bjørgen as their anchor, the dominant woman cross-country skier of the past five years, but she struggled and Norway fell out of the medals, finishing fifth. For Russia, Yevgeniya Medvedeva, bronze medalist in the pursuit in Torino, skiied the second fastest leg of the event and pulled Russia ahead to the gold medal.

Prior to the start of the 2018 Olympic Winter Games, the competition for gold was thought to be a coronation for Russian Yevgeniya Medvedeva as she would skate unchallenged to the top of the podium based on her previous season – until toward the end of 2017, when she broke her foot. That opened the door for fellow Russian teenager, 2017 World Junior champion Alina Zagitova.  The Canadians also had a few contenders to offer a legitimate challenge to the Russians having had two women on the podium at the 2017 World Championships – silver medalist Kaetlyn Osmond, who was also the 2014 Olympic team silver medalist, and 2014 Olympian Gabrielle Daleman, reigning World bronze medalist. Both were members of the gold medal winning Canadian team in the first week of the Games.
The glamour event of the Winter Olympics was once dominated by American women, who had accounted for 19 of a possible 45 Olympic medals in the ladies singles from 1952 through 2006. The Americans won no medals at the Olympics of 2010 and 2014, and had only made the podium once in the last 11 World Championships, which was Ashley Wagner’s home-soil silver in 2016. The American’s were missing her in PyeongChang after she finished fourth at the US Olympic Trials.
The short program was dominated by the rising Russian teenage stars. Zagitova had edged her rival and training partner, two-time World champion Medvedva, to top the ranking with a world record 82.92 points to Medvedva’s 81.61 points. Both left all three of their jumping passes for the second half of their program, which earned them bonus points. Osmond finished in third with 78.87 points, her season’s best score.
In the free skate, Zagitova skated to “Don Quixote”, with all 11 of her jumps back-loaded in the second half of her program on “tired legs” thus producing a 10% bonus per jump. She lead the scoring with 156.65 points, just two points shy of setting a second world record at the Games. Her combined score of 239.57 points was enough to capture the gold medal, just 1.36 points ahead of reigning World champion Medvedeva, who skated to the music of Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina” for the silver (238.26 points).
At 15 years and 281 days of age, not only did Zagitova became one of the youngest figure skating Olympic champions ever (Tara Lipinski was 15 years 8 months in 1998), she was also the first athlete who was born in the 21st century to win a gold medal.
Osmond, who finished 13th at the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, who skated to music from “Black Swan,” scored 152.15 points in her long program for a combined score of 231.02 points to capture the bronze medal. Canada hadn’t won an Olympic medal in women’s singles since Joannie Rochette claimed bronze at the 2010 Vancouver Games.
At the medal ceremony, the two Russians watched the Olympic flag being raised in their honour (instead of the Russian flag), and heard the Olympic hymn played (instead of the Russian anthem).

China and Tunisia joined the boycott, and were replaced by Czechoslovakia and Libya.
The hometown Soviet Union was a heavy favorite, having won the 1978 World Championships, the last four European titles, and 1977 World Cup. The two pools were won by the USSR and Poland, the defending gold medalists. The Soviets defeated Romania in straight sets to win one semi-final, but Poland went down to Bulgaria in the other semi, also in straights. In the final, Bulgaria was no match for the favored Soviet Union, losing in four sets. Both Bulgaria and Romania had made considerable progress in the sport. Bulgaria was only 10th at the 1978 Worlds and 1979 Europeans, while Romania was 13th at the 1978 World and seventh at the 1979 Europeans. Libya would prove to be the worst team to ever play in Olympic volleyball. They lost all five matches and all 15 sets, and were outscored 180-23. Libya won more than two points in a set only four times, scoring their most points, six, in the third set of their match against Brazil.

At the most important American meet in 1935, the AAU, Peacock had won, with Metcalfe second and Owens third. Unfortunately he was injured early in 1936 and although he tried to make the American team, was not the runner he had been in 1935. The 1936 Olympics were a showcase for Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals, the 100, 200, long jump, and on the 4x100 relay.

Two of the three East German women, Ortrun Enderlein and Anna-Maria Müller were leading after three runs (the fourth was eventually cancelled) when they were disqualified for heating the runners of their sleds. This practice gives lugers an advantage, as the warm runners melt the ice of the track, resulting in less friction when going downhill. At luge’s Olympic debut in 1964, heating of the runners was commonly practiced by nearly all competitors, but the International Luge Federation (FIL) had since forbidden this. At competitions, a technical delegate of FIL checked the sleds, measuring temperature of the runners by hand. However, after the first two runs, there were persistent rumours that the East Germans were nevertheless warming their material. This prompted the chief of the Jury, Poland’s Lucian Świderski, to test the runners himself. Witnessed by team leaders of Austria and Italy, he concluded that the three East Germans, who were in positions 1, 2 and 4 after three runs, had heated their runners, and were to be disqualified. When the 4th run was cancelled due to the poor weather, this left the title to Italy’s Erika Lechner, ahead of two West German women.

In addition to having been the runner-up in 2014, Kingsbury was the 2013 World Champion, the 2015 runner-up, the 2017 bronze medalist, and had been ranked number one in the World Cup circuit every year since the 2011-2012 season. He was not entirely bereft of competition, however; Japan’s Ikuma Horishima was the reigning World Champion in both moguls and dual moguls, while Anthony Benna of France had taken the moguls title in 2015.
Nonetheless, Kingsbury lived up to his reputation as the favorite in the first qualifying round by finishing well ahead of the rest of the field. His closest competition at this stage was Aleksandr Smyshlyayev of Russia, the 2014 Olympic and 2015 World bronze medalist who was appearing in his fourth Olympics. Horishima was fifth after the first day, while Benna qualified only in the second round. Kingsbury slipped to fourth in the tight first run of the final, with Japan’s Sho Endo, a longtime, but relatively unheralded, skier leading the pack. He had been 7th at the 2010 Olympics and 15th in 2014. Behind him were Australia’s Matt Graham, who had been 7th in 2014, and relative newcomer Daichi Hara of Japan, who had made his international debut only a year earlier. Horishima was seventh, while Benna and Smyshlyayev both failed to make the cutoff for the second run.
Kingsbury’s chances for gold improved after Endo fumbled his second run and failed to complete the course, while Horishima crashed and was also eliminated. Japan still had one competitor left in Hara, however, who managed to edge out Kingsbury in the rankings. In the final run, however, there was no doubting who the champion would be: Kingsbury, skiing in the penultimate spot, put on a spectacular performance that far eclipsed those that had gone before him. Hara skied well, but it was only good enough for bronze, allowing Kingsbury to successfully defend his nation’s title in the event and leaving Graham with the silver medal.

But Biles was back in her rightful position at the top of the leader board after a sublime routine on the beam, which included an amazing spin that earned her 15.433 points. Her final routine on the floor was just as awesome and was rewarded with 15.899 points as she won by an unprecedented 2.1 points. Team-mate Raisman took silver and the Russian Mustafina won the bronze medal to add to the one she won at London 2012 and in the 2013 World Championships. Biles’ win meant the USA became the first country to provide the winner of the individual all-round title at four consecutive Olympics.
To put into perspective how remarkable Biles’ performance was, her winning margin was 2.100 points, and since the event was launched in 1952, only one other gymnast has won by more than one point, and that was in 1968 when Čáslavská won by 1.4 points. Even more remarkably, the sum total of all winning margins in the 10 Olympics between 1976 and 2012 was 2.136, marginally better that Biles’ winning margin from just one Games.

The reigning world champion was Joey Mantia, bringing his skills from the sport of inline skating. His predecessor was Lee Seung-Hun, leader in the World Cup standings and 2010 Olympic champion in the 10,000 m as well as the home favorite. The list of medal contenders was long, though, and included among others Andrea Giovannini, Livio Wenger, Bart Swings, Peter Michael, Alexis Contin and Koen Verweij.
Most of the contenders survived the tactical semi-finals, although the elimination of 5,000 m bronze medallist Sverre Lunde Pedersen was a surprise. In the final, Wenger and Viktor Hald Thorup staged an attack after 6 laps, gaining some 75 m on the pack. Skating in service of Lee, Chung Jae-Won caught the attackers. With three laps to go, 4-time Olympic champion Sven Kramer launched an attack, with the intent of either personal gain or launching his team mate Verweij. Kramer was caught by small group, led by Swings but including Lee and Verweij. The Korean was by far the strongest in the resulting sprint, to the delight of the home crowd. Swings placed second to win Belgium’s first Winter Olympic medal in 20 years, while Verweij held on for the bronze.

She was expected to be challenged by Andrea Schöne, the 1983 World Champion, who had been second to Enke in 1982 and 1984; and Gabi Schönbrunn, who held the world record of 4:21.70, set at Medeo in 1981, and who had won the European Championships only a few weeks before at Medeo, winning the 3,000 and 5,000 at that meet. Schöne started in the first pairing and set a formidable mark, posting 4:24.79, for an Olympic record, at the time the fourth fastest ever. In the end it would win her the gold medal. Enke started in the third group, and started faster, leading through 600 metres, but after that she fell off the pace slightly, crossing in 4:26.33, but that would be good enough for the silver medal. Schönbrunn was in the next pair but never challenged her teammates at any time. She finished in 4:33.13, which would be good enough for the bronze medal, however.
The East German medal sweep was only the third ever in speed skating, following two in 1964 – by the Soviet women in the 500 and the Norwegian men in the 5,000 m. Enke ended her 1984 Winter Olympics with four medals – two gold and two silvers. She would end her Olympic career after the 1988 Calgary Games, eventually winning eight Olympics medals – three gold, four silver, and one bronze. Enke would also win 11 World Championships, six in the sprints, and five in the all-arounds. Schöne had first competed at the 1976 Winter Olympics as a 15-year-old. She would compete again in 1988, this time as Andrea Ehrig. She won three medals in Sarajevo, one gold and two silver, and would again win three medals in Calgary, finishing her Olympic career with seven medals, but this would be her only gold. Schönbrunn would also skate in Calgary, winning bronze medals in the 3,000 and 5,000, and ending her Olympic career with three bronze medals.

Ford took the lead but twenty metres from the wall he was passed by his compatriot, Wally Ris, who edged clear to win by half a second. Ford held on for silver although he was helped by the Hungarian Géza Kádas’ collision with a lane divider a stroke from the end. Jany’s sister, Ginette, was so overwhelmed by the events of the race that she collapsed and had to be stretchered away from the arena.

Prior to 1976, Curry had never defeated Kovalyov in a major event, but shortly before the Innsbruck Olympics, Curry won the European Championships, with Kovalyov second. European judges’ criticism of Curry’s skating was that it was too feminine and not athletic enough. By the time of the Olympics, Curry had supplemented his programs with enough jumps to satisfy the judges. In the competition, Sergey Volkov (URS) took the lead after the compulsories with Curry second and Kovalyov third. Curry then moved into the lead, placing second in the short program to Canada’s Toller Cranston. Kovalyov had problems in the short, placing only sixth, and dropping to fourth place overall, behind Curry, Volkov, and East Germany’s Jan Hoffmann. Curry won the free skating to secure the gold medal. Kovalyov placed only fourth in that phase but moved up to the silver medal as Volkov and Hoffmann struggled. Cranston, fifth after the short program, placed second in the free skate to win the bronze medal. Curry was an openly gay skater, as was Cranston, and would later die from AIDS in 1994.

The leading qualifiers for the final were Bob McMillen (USA), Patrick El Mabrouk (FRA), Werner Lueg (GER), Audun Boysen (NOR), Josy Barthel (LUX), and Roger Bannister (GBR). The first lap was led by Germany’s Rolf Lamers in the overly fast time of 57.8. He still led after two laps but in a more reasonable 2:01.4. Lueg led thru 1,000 metres in 2:32.8 with the field still closely bunched. He continued to lead into the last curve, with McMillen, Bannister, Barthel and El Mabrouk chasing him. Lueg finally tied up on the straight and Barthel and McMillen passed him while Bannister and El Mabrouk began to slow. In one of the greatest Olympic finishes ever, Barthel barely held off McMillen, while Lueg recovered slightly to get the bronze medal. Roger Bannister finished fourth. A bit less than two years later, on 6 May 1954, at the Iffley Road track at Oxford, Bannister ran the mile in the British AAA vs. Oxford meet. His time that day was a world record of 3:59.4, making him the first runner to better the magical 4-minute mile barrier. Barthel’s gold medal was the “first” ever for tiny Luxembourg, although in the 1990s, French athletics historian Alain Bouillé discovered that the 1900 marathon gold medalist, Michel Théato, was actually a Luxembourgeois national.

Making things more interesting was that they both were coached by former Russian Marina Zouyeva, and trained at the same rink in Detroit.
The ice dancing event was changed for the 2014 Olympics. Previously dancers had completed an original set dance and either 1, 2, or 3 compulsory dances (one since 2002), and then a free dance. But making the event consistent with the other figure skating events, the competition had been changed since Vancouver and now consisted of a short dance and a free dance. This format had been in place in all ISU events since Vancouver so the ice dancers were prepared for it.
As expected Davis/White and Virtue/Moir went 1-2 in the short dance, with the Americans taking a slight lead. The little known Russian couple Yelena Ilyinykh and Nikita Katsalapov, silver medalists at the 2012 and 2013 European Championships, was in third place. In the free dance, Davis/White skated to Scheherazade and edged out Virtue/Moir both in that phase and for the gold medal. As always with ice dancing, there was little to choose between them and the results seemed pre-determined. There was some mild controversy that this was the case and that there had even been a deal between American and Russian judges with a quid pro quo between the pairs and dance competition, but this went nowhere quickly. Ilyinykh/Katsalapov won a very surprising bronze medal.

In the process Johnson shattered the world record. He had also won the 100 at the 1986 Commonwealth Games and was world ranked #1 in both 1986 and 1987, with Lewis ranked #2 in 1987 and #3 in 1986. The Seoul 100 was expected to be a match-up between these two with American Calvin Smith, the former world record holder at 9.93, and Britain’s Linford Christie considered to have shots at medals. Lewis was fastest in the prelims, running 9.99 in the quarters and 9.97 in the semis. But the final was a runaway for Johnson, who broke his own world record with 9.79, Lewis finishing in 9.92, and Christie coming up for the bronze medal.
Or so it was thought to be. Early the next day, rumors spread throughout the Olympic Village that a 100 metre finalist had tested positive for drugs, and late in the day, it was announced that this was true and that the doping violation was on Ben Johnson for using stanazolol. Johnson was disqualified, with the gold medal going to Lewis, Christie getting a silver, and Calvin Smith moving into the medals with a bronze. As always, Johnson denied that he had ever taken performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), although by 1988 he looked as if somebody had put an air hose in his mouth and turned it on. Later that year the Canadian government began an inquiry into the use of drugs in Canadian sports, termed the Dubin Inquiry, after presiding Judge Charles Dubin. In that inquiry, Johnson eventually admitted to the long-term use of steroids, and this was confirmed by his doctor, Jamie Astaphan, and coach, Charles Francis. Johnson was suspended for two years but did return to compete internationally in the early 90s and also participated in the 1992 Olympics. His 1987 World Championship and all his world records were rescinded by the IAAF.

He opened with 21.16 (69-5¼) in round one, which led. It would be his best throw, and in fact, his only fair throw, as he followed with five fouls. In second after the first round was Ukraine’s Yuriy Bilonoh with 21.15 (69-4¾), only one centimeter back. He repeated that mark in round two but could do no better, and still trailed Nelson until the final round. In the final round Nelson had a marginal foul of around 21.30 (69-10¾), and had to settle for his opening mark. Bilonoh then threw 21.16 (69-5¼) in the final round to tie Nelson, but his next best mark was better than Nelson’s, who had no next best mark. Thus Nelson was again in second place. Finally in 2005, he would stop that trend, winning the World Championships.
But Nelson would eventually do better. In 2012 the IOC re-tested the drug samples from the Athens Olympics. Bilonoh would be disqualified in December 2012 when his doping sample revealed the presence of oxandrolone metabolite, an anabolic steroid. In June 2013 the IOC re-classified the medals, awarding Nelson the gold medal, with the silver medal going to Joachim Olsen and the bronze to Manuel Martínez.

He started in the first pair and his time of 15:23.9 was 26+ seconds under the Olympic record, only 3.6 seconds above his world record, and was the second fastest time ever. The gold seemed to be his. A challenger was thought to be Kees Verkerk (NED), but when he finished in 15:33.9 in the third pair, Maier seemed home free.

Brandin was also the winner of the Princess Royal Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta every year from 1993 through 1998 except 1994. Russia had won the 1998 World Championships, but sent a different rower, Yuliya Aleksandrova, to Sydney.
Rutschow-Stomporowski had the fastest time in the opening round, in a heat that included Aleksandrova, while Karsten, Neykova, and New Zealand’s Sonia Waddell won the other heats. Brandin, meanwhile, was eliminated in Neykova’s semi-final, which included Waddell and Australian Gina Douglas, while Germany, Belarus, and Russia all advanced in the other heat. In the medal round, the final section of the course played host to an extremely exciting conclusion, with the three front runners finishing within a second of each other and over seven seconds ahead of the rest of the field. Neykova and Karsten seemed dead even as they crossed the finish line, but a photo finish demonstrated that the latter had defended her gold medal by the slimmest of margins: 0.01 seconds. Rutschow-Stomporowski arrived very shortly thereafter, but still only in time for bronze.

Unlike the 100, this race would follow the predicted course and turn into a triumph for the USA’s Jack Medica but only after a tremendous duel. Shumpei Uto took a lead over Medica but the American fought back and narrowed a lead. A spurt by the Japanese swimmer pushed him further ahead but his exertion took much out of him and Medica responded. Medica and Uto battled for gold in the final 50 metres with the American only taking the lead with 10 metres to go.
One competitor who did not qualify from his heat was Brazil’s João Havelange. Havelange became one of the world’s leading sports administrators as both a long serving member of the IOC and as president of FIFA, the governing body of world football.

As Spain was already placed as the host nation, ninth placed France also was invited. The changes in Eastern Europe meant that the Unified Team played instead of the USSR, and the DDR had been merged into Germany. UN sanctions meant that Yugoslavia couldn’t compete, and they were substituted by Iceland, 10th at the Worlds. The continental qualifiers were Egypt, Cuba and South-Korea, but Cuba forfeited its spot, boycotting Seoul, allowing Brazil to make its Olympic début.
In the pool phase, the Swedish World Champions displayed superiority, winning all pool matches with relative ease. More remarkable was the performance of tiny Iceland. The small nation, substituting for Yugoslavia, only lost to Sweden, drew Czechoslovakia and earned a narrow but deserved win over 1988 silver medallist South Korea (26-24). This earned them second place in their pool, and thus a spot in the semis. The picture in the other pool was quite similar: the former Soviets, who had lost the 1990 World Championships final, won all their pool matches. Their only difficult match was against France, the surprise of pool B, defeating Spain in their first match (18-16) and losing narrowly against the Unified Team (23-22).
In the semi-finals, a sensation was in the air, as the Icelandic underdogs were leading 16-15 15 minutes into the second half. But they were eventually defeated by the strong ex-Soviets, Talant Duyshebayev netting nine goals. In the other match, Sweden led France comfortably (20-14) but saw their lead disappear quickly in the last part of the match. The French came to within one goal (23-22) but ultimately were defeated 24-22.
In a rematch of the 1990 World Championship final, the first half remained tied at 9 each. Sweden appeared to distance itself from the Unified Team in the second half (14-12), but this was overcome quickly, and the former Soviet squad won its third title, after 1976 and 1988. In the bronze medal match, the two surprise semi-finalists battled it out, France ending up on the podium.

The heavy favorite was Shaun White of the United States, the defending champion, who had taken the sport to new dimensions with his famed Double McTwist (three horizontal inside two vertical flips) and the double cork spin (two off-axis rotations, or diagonal flips) since his victory in 2006. Since Torino, he had won the superpipe at the Winter X Games in both 2008 and 2009. There were questions about the sport in 2010, as a pre-Games contender, American Kevin Pearce, had hit his head hard on the top of pipe while attempting a double cork spin, and had sustained a severe traumatic brain injury. Only a few weeks earlier, at the Winter X Games, White had won the superpipe, but had hit his chin on the top of pipe on one run, fortunately not severely injuring himself.
White qualified comfortably for the final in Vancouver. In his first run in the final he scored 46.8 (out of 50) to lead comfortably over Scotty Lago (USA) with 42.8 and Swiss rider Iouri Podladtchikov, who had competed at Torino for Russia, and had recently been second to White at the Winter X Games with 42.4 points. Many of the competitors had ambitious programs for their second run, but most failed to complete their runs without serious error. One exception was Peetu Piiroinen (FIN), runner-up at the 2009 US Open, who exceeded his 40.8 first run score with a run worth 45.0 points that moved him into second place. By the time White was to start his second run, he was already assured of the gold medal, and thrilled the crowd by putting in his trademark Double McTwist movement for an outstanding score of 48.4 points.

Due to the postponement of the men’s downhill, the event was held on the same day, with the starting times adjusted so as not to clash with the men.
Three racers shared the wins in the six events held in the ongoing giant slalom World Cup, with Mikaela Shiffrin winning the first two races, in Sölden and Courchevel 1, while Tessa Worley won in Lienz, and Sara Hector in Courchevel 2, and also the last two races before the Games, in Kranjska Gora, and Kronzplatz. Hector also led the World Cup standings followed by Worley and Shiffrin.
The Crystal Globes in this event had been won by Viktoria Rebensburg (2018), who had retired in 2020, Mikaela Shiffrin (2019), Federica Brignone (2020), and Marta Bassino (2021), but the last two World Championships had been won by Petra Vlhová (2019) and Lara Gut-Behrami (2021). During the current season Gut-Behrami contested only two of the six races also because of a COVID-19 illness. Shiffrin was also the gold medallist from PyeongChang, with Mowinckel winning silver and Brignone taking bronze.
Skiers from 49 different nations started the race, which was a record for female Alpine skiing events. The race was started by Vlhová but she was soon overtaken by the next racer, Michelle Gisin. Brignone started next and bettered Gisin’s time by 1.21 seconds. Worley wearing bib number 4 was not able to reach Brignone, being 0.95 seconds behind. After Bassino did not finish her run, it was Hector who took the lead by 42/100ths of a second. As Shiffrin was also not able to finish the race, others took their chance with Katharina Truppe surprisingly finishing in second place, only 3/10ths behind Hector, and also Meta Hrovat (fourth), Ragnhild Mowinckel (fifth), and Nina O’Brien (sixth) bringing themselves into the top positions.
On the second run Coralie Frasse Sombet, who was 26th on the first run, set the early pace with what was finally the third best time of the second run, to finish 17th overall. Vlhová, only 13th after the first run, was not in contention and did not improve on the second run, finishing 14th overall. The second-best time on run two brought Thea Stjernesund down from 15th after run one, to a final sixth place. The best run time was set by Gut-Behrami, which was good enough for bronze as, of those in the top three after the first run, only Truppe dropped to an unfortunate fourth place, 0.08 seconds away from bronze. Brignone took silver while Hector brought down her lead to win Sweden’s first gold medal in this event since Pernilla Wiberg back in 1992. Hector (gold) and Gut-Behrami (bronze) used Head skis, while Brignone (silver) raced Rossignol and Truppe (fourth) Fischer.
After Shiffrin did not finish the first run, the second run cased more back luck for Team USA as O’Brien endured troubles shortly before the finish line. She crashed into the last gate and badly fell into the finish area. After several minutes of first-aid she was transported to hospital where she was treated for an open left tibia and fibula fracture.
Finishing 38th in this event was Aruwin Salehhuddin, who became the first ever female Winter Olympics competitor for Malaysia, and the last finisher Kiana Kryeziu achieved the same claim for her country Kosovo. Sarah Escobar was the first ever Winter Olympian from Ecuador, while Noa Szőllős and Gwyneth Ten Raa became the first ever female Alpine skier for Israel and Luxembourg, respectively.

There were two leading contenders, with diametrically different running styles. On 2 February 1974, Tanzania’s Filbert Bayi won the greatest 1,500 run to that date, at the Commonwealth Games. His time of 3:32.16 was a world record, and he needed it to defeat John Walker of New Zealand, who placed second in 3:32.52, also surpassing the previous record. On 17 May 1975, at the International Freedom Games in Jamaica, Bayi then broke the world mile record with 3:51.0, but that mark would not last long. In Göteborg, Sweden, on 12 August, Walker became the first runner to break the 3:50 barrier, winning the mile in 3:49.4. Walker was a solid middle-distance runner with an excellent kick, while Bayi was an almost maniacal front runner who set what seemed to be suicidal paces. The Olympic match-up between them was highly anticipated.
But it never happened. Tanzania joined the African boycott of the Montréal Olympics and Bayi could not compete. In his absence, Walker seemed a cinch for the gold medal. But his 1976 form was not what it had been in 1974-75. He suffered from chronic compartment syndrome in both his lower legs, which would later require surgery, and he had to back off on his training, running shorter distances but of very high quality. Among the nine finalists in Montréal, only Ireland’s Eamonn Coghlan was a top miler, with many of the others being better known as 800 metre runners. The pace was quite slow, with Coghlan leading thru 800 and 1,200 metres in 2:03.15 and 3:01.23. Walker then took off on the backstretch and led out a 300 metre sprint. He quickly took the lead and his anerobic capacity held off the runners to win the gold medal, with Belgium’s Ivo Van Damme adding a silver medal to the one he had earned earlier in the 800. Before the end of the year, Van Damme was killed in a car crash. In his honor, the Ivo Damme Memorial athletics meeting is held annually in Brussels.

At the recent Winter X-Games, Wise and Rolland had gone 1-2 with Riddle fourth, American Alex Ferreira taking bronze. Wise was a solid favorite, having won the event at the last three Winter X-Games.
Poor weather greeted the skiiers as qualifying was held in heavy snow, and the final was contested early in sleet and freezing rain, which changed back to thick, heavy snowflakes as the event progressed. The three medal favorites all came thru in the first run of qualifying to make it to the final. On the first run of the final Wise blasted a 92.00 with a run that included both right- and left-sided double corked 1260s. Rolland stood second after the first run, but Riddle came back on the second run with a flawless run, but with slightly less difficulty, scoring 90.60. Wise would win the gold medal, giving him the Triple Crown of Olympic, World Championship and X-Games gold. Riddle took silver and Rolland bronze, with Rolland joining Wise as medalists at the Big 4 halfpipe events of Olympics, World Championships, Winter X, and Winter X Europe.

But the gold medal final was not only another old rivalry, but a rematch between Vlasov and 2015 World silver medalist Mark O.

They knew each other well having previously fought five times before. Midway through the first period of their gold medal match, Vlasov scored four points, and picked up another point in the next period after Madsen’s corner unsuccessfully challenged a call. And after giving up a point for passivity late in the match, Vlasov took a 5-1 victory  over Madsen, winning his second Olympic gold medal.
In the semi-finals, Vlasov was in the lead when he was choked unconscious by Božo Starčević of Croatia on a legal move, and while officials awarded Starčević two points, they stopped the bout when they realized Vlasov had blacked out.

However, since the break-up of Yugoslavia into its constituent republics, Croatia had won a silver medal in 1996, and Serbia had won silver in 2004 and bronze in 2008, but the former Yugoslav republics had yet to win an Olympic title.
Both Serbia and Croatia came into London among the favorites. Serbia had won the 2011 World League Super-Final, and Croatia had won a bronze medal at the 2011 World Championships. At the 2010 World Cup, Serbia had defeated Croatia in the final.
Croatia was drawn in Group A and Serbia in Group B and they both won their respective groups, with Croatia winning all five group matches, while Serbia was tied by another Yugoslav remnant, Montenegro. In the knock-out round, Croatia easily defeated the United States in the quarter-finals and then beat Montenegro, 7-5, to advance to the final. On the other side of the draw, Serbia handled Australia easily, but then lost to Italy, the 2011 World Champions, in the semi-finals, 9-7, setting up a Croatia-Italy final.
In the final, Italy opened the scoring with the first two goals, leading 2-0, but Croatia led at the half, 3-2. Italy tied it up, 3-3, early in the third period, but Croatia then scored four consecutive goals to open a 7-3 lead, and put the match away. Italy came back a little, but Croatia’s first Olympic water polo gold medal was never in much doubt in the second half. The bronze was a re-match of Serbia and Montenegro, with Serbia winning the bronze medal, 12-11.

The Czech Republic’s Martin Fuksa was a potential contender, as the 2014 and 2015 World runner-up, the 2013 European Champion, and the 2016 European bronze medallist, while Serghei Tarnovschi, formerly of Ukraine but now competing for Moldova, was the only other recent World Champion medallist (having won bronze in 2015) at the Games.
Brendel and Tarnovschi won their preliminaries, allowing them to advance to the final directly, but Fuksa was bested by Brazil’s Isaquias Queiroz, the reigning Pan-American Champion. This forced him to compete in the semifinals, which he won alongside Russia’s Ilya Shtokalov. The final, however, was a two-man showdown between Brendel and Queiroz, but the Brazilian could not match the German’s prowess and was forced to settle for silver. Nonetheless, this made him Brazil’s first Olympic canoeing medallist and he would go on to take bronze in the C-1 200 and silver in the C-2 1000 to become the first Brazilian to win three medals in a single Olympics. Over two seconds later, Tarnovschi edged out Shtokalov to capture the final podium spot. Two days later, however, Tarnovschi’s placement was suspended after he failed a doping test - although the IOC later reinstated him pending an International Canoe Federation hearing. In February 2017 he was given a four year ban by that organization and stripped of all his results since July 8. Shtokalov was upgraded to the bronze medal, which he received on 10 September 2018 at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne.

The British ASA title had been won in 1909, 1911, and 1912 by Britain’s Jennie Fletcher.  The world record at the beginning of 1912 was held over 110 yards by Daisy Curwen (GBR) with 1:24.6, set in Liverpool on 29 September 1911.  In preparation for the Olympics, Curwen herself broke that mark on 10 June 1912, posting 1:20.6 at Birkenhead.
Australia was to be represented by Fanny Durack and Mina Wylie, but not without some effort.  Originally the Australian sports authorities did not wish to “waste” money on sending women to the Olympics.  Finally, the New South Wales Ladies’ Amateur Swimming Association voted to allow the two to go to the Olympics, providing they paid their own way.  A fund was raised which paid Durack’s expenses and Wylie’s family and friends provided her support.  Durack’s sister, Mary, served as their chaperone on the long boat trip.
Mina Wylie had been the better of the two swimmers up to a year before the 1912 Olympics, and she had never lost to Durack to that time.  But Durack changed to the new crawl stroke, from the Trudgeon, and after that, Wylie never defeated Durack.  Prior to the 1912 Olympics, Durack posted world records over 50 yards (27.0), 100 yards (66.0), and 220 yards (2:56.0).  In her first round heat at Stockholm, she broke Curwen’s world record for 100 metres with a time of 1:19.8.
The final came down to Durack, Wylie, and Fletcher.  Daisy Curwen competed in Stockholm and qualified for the final, but had to withdraw when she was rushed to hospital for an emergency appendectomy.  It is unlikely she would have challenged Durack in the final, who won easily in 1:22.2.  A few days later, in an exhibition in the Stockholm Swimming Stadium, Durack broke the world record for 300 metres with a time of 4:43.6.  She eventually set 11 world records between 1906 and 1921.  Although she planned to compete at the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, that was derailed when, shortly before the Games, she suffered the same fate as Daisy Curwen, and missed the Olympics recovering from an appendectomy.

This placed the top four nations of the World Cup season in the Olympic final as well.
The final was a thrilling race, with there being little between the four teams until the halfway stage, when the Italian team crashed during a changeover. Korea then went ahead of China and made a run for the finishing line from some distance, with Canada slowly dropping off the pace. Coming into the final laps China put in a tremendous effort to take the lead as they entered the last lap. However Shim Seok-Hui overtook Li Jianrou on the outside to claim the gold medal for Korea. There was still drama to come as a review of the race found the Chinese had committed an infringement as Zhou Yang had failed to clear the track fast enough after an exchange and had impeded the Koreans. The team were relegated, Canada being promoted to the silver medal and Italy to the bronze. This was a reversal of fortunes compared to the 2010 Olympic final, when China won gold after the Koreans were disqualified.

The last four ABA Champions were present - John Douglas (1905), Arthur Murdoch (1906), Rube Warnes (1907 and 1910), and William Childs (1908-09, and 1911).
The final came down to Douglas and Baker, and was described as the best match of the tournament. The first round was even. Douglas knocked Baker down in round two, but he continued in a closely fought battle. However, Douglas hung on in round three to win on points. Douglas was presented his gold medal by his father, who was then the President of the ABA. John Douglas, the son, was actually better known as a cricketer and later captained Essex County and England teams. He and his father died tragically in a sea disaster returning from Finland in December 1930.
Snowy Baker is the greatest all-around athlete ever produced by Australia. He competed at the 1908 Olympics in boxing, diving, and swimming. In addition to those three sports, he represented Australia at the international level in rugby union and water polo. He was also state or national caliber in cricket, track & field athletics, and rowing. In December 1908, he was appointed referee for the Jack Johnson vs. Tommy Burns heavyweight professional bout, which was held in Sydney, but Johnson objected to Baker’s snow-white hair (hence his nickname), and he was replaced. Baker later became a movie star and stuntman.

Dermott Lennon, the Irishman who had won the 2002 world title missed the Games as his gold medal winning horse, Liscalgot, had suffered an injury in 2003 that would eventually end her career. The same fate befell another top contender, For Pleasure, the mount of Germany’s Marcus Ehning had to be withdrawn shortly before the Games when it too fell lame. A different reason was responsible for the non-appearance of the top German Meredith Michaels-Beerbaum, her horse Shutterfly tested positive for the sedative hydroxylpromazine at the World Cup final earlier in the year and the German federation did not consider her for Athina. Of those that reached Athina, the Brazilian Rodrigo Pessoa and his “superstar” horse Baloubet du Rouet had been consistently amongst the world’s best for nearly a decade, German riders had finished 1-2-3 in the 2003 European Championships and Jos Lansink, in his fifth Olympics, although this time representing Belgium instead of the Netherlands, was also considered amongst those in strong contention for medals.
A single qualifying round held on 22 August was added to individual results from the team competition, those riding solely as individuals competed over the same course with the top 45 competitors moving into the final. The rule stating that only three from each nation could qualify for the final proved costly for the European champion Christian Ahlmann of Germany, he finished 19th but only fourth German.
Qualifying scores were not carried through to the final which consisted of two rounds of jumping over courses of increased difficulty. Only two riders produced faultless first rounds, Jessica Chesney-Kürten of Ireland and the veteran Briton Nick Skelton. Skelton was a sentimental favourite, having retired in 2000 following a fall in which he suffered a double fracture of his C1 vertebrae. By 2002 the injury had sufficiently healed that surgeons were able to declare him fit to resume his career. The outsider Daniel Meech of New Zealand placed third with a single time penalty but no less than 28 riders were within eight penalties of the leaders.
For the second round riders went in the order of their positions with the leaders going last. Pessoa was the first rider to go clear, adding zero to his first round score of eight. As those around him produced disappointing performances he moved up the leaderboard until the entry into the arena of Ireland’s Cian O’Connor. O’Connor and Waterford Crystal jumped impeccably and stayed on their round one score of four faults. With only the last three combinations to go O’Connor still led with Pessoa and the USA’s Chris Kappler jointly in second. Meech and Skelton produced identical rounds, knocking three fences down and being slightly over the allowed time. This guaranteed a gold medal to Ireland, a nation that prides itself on its’ horsemanship, for the first time in Olympic equestrianism. The only question was whether it would go O’Connor or to Chesney-Kürten. In the event Chesney-Kürten would have a disastrous round, knocking five fences over and O’Connor would win the gold. A jump-off for the silver medal was decided in favour of Pessoa when Royal Kaliber, Chris Kappler’s mount, pulled up lame.
On 8 October 2004 it was announced that a urine sample taken from Waterford Crystal had tested positive for prohibited substances. The substances were later revealed to be zuclopenthixol and fluphenazine, anti-psychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia in humans. O’Connor requested that the “B” sample be tested but it was reported missing, believed stolen, in transit between Medication Control Programme Central Laboratory in Paris and the Horseracing Forensic Laboratory in Newmarket, England. On the day that the news of the theft became public, the offices of the Irish Equestrian Federation were broken into and some documents taken although no link to the case has ever been proven. A blood sample taken at the same time as the urine sample was later tested and the results confirmed the previous findings. The explanation given by O’Connor was that the horse suffered a fetlock injury a month prior to the Games and his veterinary surgeon recommended the horse be given a mild sedative to prevent him becoming upset, which might have caused further injury. Although the FEI inquiry absolved O’Connor of deliberate doping he was stripped of his medal, his Olympic results were annulled and he received a three-month ban from competition. Rodrigo Pessoa of Brazil inherited the gold medal, Chris Kappler (USA) moved up to silver and Germany’s Marco Kutscher took the bronze.

Halfway through the first round all was going well for Japan. Okabe and Saito had put the Japanese into lead and next it was the turn of world champion Harada to jump, but Harada’s effort turned into an unmitigated disaster, and even caused his team to be subtracted points from their total. Austria, Germany and Norway would all overtake Japan and fill the first three places as the first round closed. During the interval between the two rounds snow fell and it seemed possible that the second round might be cancelled and Austria would be crowned champions. To the relief of the home fans the weather improved and the event continued. The pattern for the second set of jumps mirrored the first and Japan gained back points from their opening jumpers. When Harada stood at the top of the hill for his second jump the title was again within his team’s reach. As his nation collectively held their breath he came down the ramp, leapt and then hung in the air for an eternity, landing only at 137.0 m to equal the Olympic best set minutes earlier by Okabe. This gave Japan a clear lead with only a distance of 90.5 needed by Funaki to ensure victory. Funaki’s leap of 125 m was the cue for wild celebrations and considerable relief for the home team.

Early in the season, Johann Olav Koss had broken the world record in this distance on the Olympic ice, skating 6:35.53, well ahead of his Dutch rivals. But at the European Championships, also skated at the Olympic rink in Hamar, Koss had not been in great shape, and had placed only fourth, with Rintje Ritsma winning. The Dutch had also prepared a )secret weapon) for the Olympics, a new aerodynamic cover for the skates. It was officially called the delta skate, but went by other nicknames such as the )condom skate) or FTN-skate ()F*** the Norwegians) skate). Used only by Ritsma, the new skate was not very successful, and it would never be used again in competition.
The first contender to race was Kjell Storelid, a Norwegian. He had only once placed on the World Cup podium (in January 1994), but had been a consistent top 10 skater at the distance. Cheered on by his compatriots, he skated the best race of his life with 6:42.68. This seemed beatable by 1993 World Champion Falko Zandstra, but he faded badly late in the race and ended at 6:44.58. Then, it was Koss, who started with his own world record schedule in mind. Skating incredibly flat - all laps were between 30.86 and 32.01 - Koss beat his own mark by half a second: 6:34.96. Two pairs later, Ritsma attempted a do-or-die race. Starting faster than the Norwegian, his splits were over two seconds faster at 1,800 m. But his fast pace cost him dearly, and Ritsma eventually wound up in third place with 6:43.94, well above his own best time.

This left the world title to Salvador del Rosario of the Philippines. The 1971 title was taken by Poland’s Zygmunt Smalcerz, also the 1971 and 1972 European Champion.
Smalczer and Holczreiter both opened with a press of 112.5 kg, with Del Rosario already back 15 kg and out of contention. The snatch was taken by Burma’s Gyi Aung Maung, who beat the world record at 105.0 kg. Smalczer placed second with 100 kg and gained 7.5 kg on Holczreiter. In the final event Smalczer cleared 125.0 kg, but then missed twice at 130.0 kg. As Holczreiter only managed 122.5 kg, the Pole’s first place was not threatened, and Holczreiter was in fact passed by his compatriot Lajos Szűcs, who moved up from third place. The clean & jerk was won by Pak Dong-Geun, although Indonesia’s Charles Depthios managed a new world record in a post-competition lift with 132.5 kg.

From the quarter-finals the draw neatly split into a section of European boxers and a section from the rest of the world. Gilroy’s progress was checked at the semi-final stage by Wolfgang Behrendt of Germany who had only recently moved up in weight from flyweight whilst Song Sun-Cheon became the first Korean Olympic boxing finalist when he dispatched Claudio Barrientos of Chile in the other semi-final. By defeating Song, Behrendt became the first boxer from the GDR to win an Olympic title although it should be pointed out that East and West competed in a combined German team in 1956.

All Russian weightlifters, however, were banned from Rio over doping concerns, which left Deng (the clean and jerk world record holder) and Choe the favorites in the event. This also meant that, due to Russia’s strong presence at the tournament, Italy’s Giorgia Bordignon (bronze in 2015 and 2016) was the only recent European medalist at the Games.
Deng tied the Olympic record 115 kg, only 2 kg off the world record, in the snatch portion, while Karina Goricheva of Kazakhstan was behind her at 111 kg. Thailand’s Rattikan Kulnoi was third after this element, with a lift of 108 kg; she had come fourth at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the lightweight division, although the original bronze medalist, Yuliya Kalina of Ukraine, had been disqualified over doping concerns. Choe, meanwhile, was well behind in fourth, with a lift of 105 kg.

But by 1988 he was far from the swimmer he had once been. He had placed fourth in this event at the 1986 Worlds, won by West Germany’s Rainer Henkel, and had not qualified for the final of the 1987 Europeans. The Soviet swim coaches did not choose him for the 1988 Olympic team, but the Soviet Minister of Sport intervened and Salnikov was placed on the team, and he pushed his training in an attempt to regain his old form.
In the final Salnikov swam behind American Matt Cetlinski for the first 600 metres, pulling slightly ahead at 700. West German Stefan Pfeiffer moved into second at 950 metres, as Salnikov continued to increase his lead, and Cetlinski dropped back to third. Just before 1,400 m the 400 gold medalist, Uwe Daßler of the GDR, caught Cetlinski. Salnikov continued to power ahead until the final 100, when Pfeiffer closed slightly. But it was not enough as Salnikov won his second gold medal in the event, with Pfeiffer second, and Daßler third. For Cetlinski, it was further disappointment as he placed fourth, as he had in the 400.

All competitors cleared through 1.50 metres. The horses and riders were allowed three attempts at each successive height, as with human high jumping. The 1900 Olympic title was shared at 1.85 metres by Italian Giangiorgio, Count Trissino, aboard Oreste and Frenchman Dominique Gardères, who rode Canéla (owned by Count Oscar Heeren). Riding a different horse, Mélepo, Trissino also finished fourth in this event. There was a jump-off to decide the third and fourth places between Count Trissino and Georges Van Der Poele, aboard Ludlow.
The best on record in this era was 2.40 metres set by Heatherbloom, ridden by Dick Donnelly at Richmond, Virginia in 1902, although Heatherbloom and Donnelly had unofficial marks in 1902 of 2.49 and 2.515 metres. However, the first recognized FEI (Fédération Équestre Internationale) high jump record was 2.35 metres by Conspirateur, ridden by Captain Crousse (FRA) at the Grand Palais in Paris on 12 April 1906. The final FEI recognized high jump record in the 20th century was 2.47 metres by Huaso, ridden by Alberto Larraguibel Morales at an international show in Santiago, Chile on 5 February 1949.
A more modern variant of this event is now contested, termed the puissance. It is also a high jump event but with some differences in the details of the fences and the competition. The current indoor record for puissance is held by German rider Franke Sloothaak, who in June 1991 jumped 2.40 metres in Chaudfontaine, Belgium, riding Optiebeurs Golo.

The reigning European Champion was Larisa Iordache, also from Romania, as was the runner-up Cătălina Ponor, a three time Olympic gold medalist from the 2004 Games (including the floor exercises).
The qualification round was won by Aly Raisman of the United States, bronze medalist in the event at the most recent World Championships. Izbașa came in second, followed by Vanessa Ferrari of Italy, the 2007 European Champion. Afanasyeva came in fourth, Ponor in seventh, and Iordache deep in the field at 32nd. Raisman went third in the finals and there was no question that she was the Olympic champion, earning a 15.600 with the highest difficulty and execution scores of the evening. Ponor came out next, putting forth a valiant effort to catch up to Raisman, but in the end the American was untouchable and Ponor settled for silver with 15.200 points. No other competitor scored above 15.000, leaving Aliya Mustafina of Russia to capture bronze, her fourth medal of the Olympics after gold on the uneven bars, silver in the team all-around, and bronze in the individual all-around.

By contrast, the top Russian sled with Aleksandr Zubkov at the helm had a consistent but not spectacular season but their entire efforts for the year were totally concentrated on the Sochi Games.
Zubkov and his crewmate, professional arm wrestling champion Aleksey Voyevoda, used their extensive knowledge of the Olympic track to great advantage. The pairing set a track record on their 1st run to open up a lead that was expanded on in every subsequent run. This was achieved despite strong rumours that the two men had an antagonistic relationship. After bronze medals in 2006 and 2010, Hefti’s Swiss sled moved up to silver in 2014 with Holcomb’s US sled narrowly beating off the challenge of the 2nd Russian sled to claim the bronze medal. This was the first American medal in the event for 62 years.
A major talking point was the lack of performance of the German crews. Germany had placed a crew on the podium on every World Championship events in the years since the Vancouver Olympics but 2013-14 had slowly turned into a disaster for them. Francesco Friedrich had been World Champion 12 months earlier but he lost his fight against the technical inadequacies of his equipment and could only scrape a top ten finish. To add salt to the wound German car giant BMW were in partnership with the US team and designed the team’s sleds.
The return of a Jamaican team to the Olympic arena gained much publicity with 46 year old Winston Watts making a comeback after missing the Torino and Vancouver Games.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
All eight members of the Russian bobsleigh teams, which originally finished first and fourth in this event were disqualified in November-December 2017. Appeals were made immediately to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but were denied and the Russian teams remained disqualified and the medals were re-allocated.
A special committee of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) was then charged with investigating these findings, but refused to acknowledge the disqualifications and allowed all the sliders to continue competing. The IOC was not happy with that ruling and the Executive Committee of the IBSF then appealed to the CAS, against its own sub-committee, to have that ruling overturned.

Although many Europeans now played in the NHL, Canada and the United States still provided the bulk of the players in the world’s best ice hockey league.

Canada had last won a gold medal in ice hockey in 1952, and the United States had won only the two upsets of 1960 and 1980.  But both of those were on home ice, and with the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the Americans were optimistic.
Canada easily won their semi-final match, 7-1, against Belarus.  The other semi-final saw the United States defeat Russia, 3-2, in one of the most exciting Olympic games ever played.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"The men’s heavyweight class was contested in Tokyo over a weight up to 109 kg which was almost equal to former heavyweight classes, -110 kg (1972-1992) and -108 kg (1996), but was four kilograms higher as the second-heaviest class held from 2000-16, when it was 105 kg.
The best qualifier was Simon Martirosyan, the world record holder in total with 435 kg. He was also the 2018 and 2019 world champion, and 2019 European champion, but he missed a valid attempt in clean & jerk at the European Championships in April 2021 and was placed last. The season’s best lifter was Ruslan Nurudinov, who won the Asian championships in April 2021 with a new world record in clean & jerk (241 kg) and a total of 429 kg. After his samples from the 2012 London Games had been re-tested, they revealed doping and he was suspended for two years from December 2018. He was therefore prevented from qualifying for Tokyo as it was required to compete in at least one event in each of the three qualifying periods. As Yang Zhe was not selected for the Chinese team, because only four male athletes per nation were allowed to compete, it meant the world record holder in snatch with 200 kg, achieved at the Asian championships in April 2021, was also not present in Tokyo. This meant Akbar Djuraev was the season best qualifier with 428 kg, set on the way to winning silver at the last Asian championships. Behind Martirosyan and Djuraev, the field was wide open as numerous athletes had performed on almost the same level. They were Timur Naniyev, the only male weightlifter for the Russian Olympic Committee competing in Tokyo, with a qualification best of 409 kg, Hristo Hristov, season best 406 kg, or Ali Hashemi and Artūrs Plēsnieks, both with qualification bests of 405 kg.
The snatch element did not create any surprises as Martirosyan lifted 195 kg and Djuraev 193 kg, followed by Hristov 189 kg, Naniyev 188 kg, and Hashemi 184 kg, while Plēsnieks and Jin Yun-Seong cleared 180 kg. These results indicated what was to come in the rest of the competition. As expected, the clean & jerk element was also close for all three medal positions from early on. Hristov lifted 219 kg in his second attempt, while Naniyev lifted 221 kg and Plēsnieks cleared 225 kg in their second lifts, which gave Naniyev the lead with 409 kg, followed by Hristov on 408 kg and Plēsnieks on 405 kg. Naniyev, Hristov, and Jin all failed to improve their totals while Hashemi failed to clear any weight, but Plēsnieks came from behind and lifted a personal best 230 kg for a total of 410 kg to get into the bronze medal position. The race for gold was started by Djuraev who cleared 227 kg with his first attempt, which was answered with a 228 kg by Martirosyan. After Djuraev failed to lift 234 kg, Martirosyan tried to put pressure on the young Uzbek as he increased the weight so that Djuraev had to lift again immediately, but this went wrong when Djuraev cleared 237 kg in his last attempt. Martirosyan had to go for 238 kg, three kilograms more than needed for gold, but he failed both lifts and won a second successive silver medal.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 193 kg for snatch, 231 kg for clean & jerk, and 419 kg for total. Martirosyan set an Olympic record in snatch with 195 kg while Djuraev set a record in clean & jerk with 237 kg and he then set the in total record with 420 kg, until bettered by Martirosyan with 423 kg, but Djuraev got it back after lifting 430 kg.

The other semi matched Kazakh Islam Bayramukov against Poland’s Marek Garmulewicz, twice a silver medalist at the Europeans and once at the Worlds, with Bayramukov shutting out the Pole, 3-0.

When the IOC initially voted to eliminate wrestling from the Olympic Program in 2013, Murtazaliyev returned his gold medal to the IOC in protest of the decision, which was later reversed. Murtazaliyev took back his gold medal.

In late 2005, he also bettered the world record in the event, although Sven Kramer lowered it again the next weekend. This feat also made Kramer Hedrick’s foremost contender, in addition to Carl Verheijen, Norwegians Ervik and Grødum, and home favorite Enrico Fabris. To add to the pressure, Hedrick had boldly announced that he would be aiming for 5 gold medals in Torino, competing in the 1,000, 1,500, 5,000, 10,000 and team pursuit.
Verheijen led the pack with 6:18.84 when Kramer started. With a solid race, he timed 6:16.40, but left room for Hedrick on some of his laps. With Hedrick starting the very next pair, Kramer’s time was soon doomed. Hedrick quickly took a 1-second lead, slowly extending it to about 2 seconds. Hedrick’s final time was quite close to the Olympic Record set at high altitude, finishing in an excellent 6:14.68. The remaining skaters were no threat to Hedrick. Skating in the final pair, it appeared Enrico Fabris could not medal either, trailing Verheijen’s time by more than 2 seconds at 3,800 m.

Kozák and Schmidt were not unknowns, having been runners-up in the most recent European Championships, but their performance was surprising nonetheless. The Soviets managed to advance due to their performance in the repêchage, but Great Britain was eliminated.

Sadly for the Dutchwoman, it was already known that she would not be going to Melbourne as the Dutch team had been withdrawn from the Games as a protest against the Soviet invasion of Hungary. She heard about the boycott while showing off her Olympic outfit to her club mates. At that point, her coach decided she’d do a world record attempt - a race specifically to set a record, with Den Haan swimming alone against the clock.
Without Den Haan, swimmers from Germany and, ironically, Hungary assumed the mantle of favouritism.
The main beneficiary of the Dutch absence turned out to be Germany’s Ursula Happe. Happe, at 30 years of age and the mother of two children, was much the oldest of the swimming champions of 1956. She had retired from competition in 1955, after falling pregnant for the second time, but backtracked on her decision and decided to train for the Melbourne Olympics. Happe captured the gold medal ahead of Éva Székely of Hungary with another German, Eva-Maria ten Elsen, in third.

The USA woman had won a medal at every Olympics since 2004 and, with three gold and two bronzes, helped the United States be the only women’s team to medal at four consecutive Games. Their best chance in Tokyo was with the World Championships silver medallists Alix Klineman and April Ross, the second ranked pair in Tokyo, while the sixth ranked Kelly Claes and Sarah Sponcil were also US contenders. Brazil had not won the women’s title since the sport made its début at Atlanta in 1996, but they had a good chance of rectifying that in Tokyo with the third ranked Eduarda Lisboa (known as Duda) and Ágatha, the 2016 Rio silver medallist.
Since winning the 2019 Word Championship in Hamburg, the Canadian pair of Sarah Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes had put themselves in contention for a medal place in Tokyo, along with the German 2016 Olympic gold medallist Laura Ludwig and her new partner Margareta Kozuch. Ludwig returned to the sport in 2019 at the age of 33, after taking time off to have a baby. The Canadians were the topped ranked pair in Tokyo
The Czech par of Barbora Hermannová and Markéta Sluková were unable to play their pool matches because of COVID-19. The shock of the pool matches was the departure of the fancied Netherlands duo Sanne Keizer and Madelein Meppelink, who exited after three defeats, while the Brazilians Ana Patrícia and Rebecca Silva were expected to win their pool, but defeat by Claes and Sponcil in their final match meant they could only finish third after just one win, but they still made it through to the last 16. The closest pool match was that between Switzerland’s Nina Betschart and Tanja Hüberli and Germany’s Kozuch and Ludwig. The Swiss duo won 23-25, 22-20, 16-14.
Claes and Sponcil were eliminated in the last 16 by Canada’s Heather Bansley and Brandie Wilkerson, despite winning the first set. The two Brazil teams were in action on the opening day of the knockout competition. Ana Patrícia and Rebecca beat the highest ranked Chinese pair of Wang Fan and Xia Xinyi, and gold medal prospects Ágatha and Duda had a potentially mouth-watering game against Germany’s Kozuch and Ludwig. It turned out to be very close as the third ranked Brazilians lost by the narrowest of margins 21-19, 19-21, 16-14. On Duda’s 22nd birthday, she and Ágatha had match point at 14-13 in the tie-breaker, but the Germans won three-in-a-row to clinch it.
The all-Swiss clash between the tenth ranked Joana Heidrich and Anouk Vergé-Dépré and number seven ranked Betschart and Hüberli went to a deciding tie-breaker set, which was the longest of the match, and was won by Heidrich and Vergé-Dépré 23-21. With four teams seeded between 10 and 18 in the quarter-finals, it looked as though there could be a surprise winner of the women’s title.
April and Alix made themselves favourite for the gold medal after an impressive 21-19, 21-19 quarter-final win over Ludwig and Kozuch. Alix was a former indoor volleyball player who switched to beach to team up with April in late 2017. A place in the semi-final put April one step closer to the elusive gold to go with the silver she won in London 2012, and bronze at Rio in 2016. Going into the semi, their record was an impressive 5-0. Switzerland’s Heidrich and Vergé-Dépré caused a shock by beating the Brazilians Ana Patrícia and Rebecca, who had been struggling since qualifying from their pool in third place.
There were two Canadian pairs in the quarter-finals and the ninth ranked Bansley and Wilkerson came unstuck against Latvia’s Anastasija Kravčenoka and Tīna Graudiņa 15-12 in the deciding third set. The other Canadians, however, the top ranked Pavan and Melissa, were expected to go through to the last four but lost in three sets to the Australians Clancy and Artacho.
In the semi-final, the Australians won in two sets against the Latvians to become only the second Australian women to reach an Olympic final since Natalie Cook and Kerri-Ann Pottharst at Sydney in 2000. In the other semi-final, the American pair of April and Alix had an easy 21-12, 21-11 over the surprise semi-finalists Heidrich and Vergé-Dépré. For the first time in beach volleyball Olympic history, there was no Brazilian team in the semi-final of the women’s competition.
Switzerland won their first ever beach volleyball medal when Heidrich and Vergé-Dépré beat Kravčenoka and Graudiņa to take the bronze medal, while gold went to the favourites April and Alix, or the “A-team” as they had become known, who beat Clancy and Artacho 21-15, 21-16 in just 43 minutes. Victory gave the United States their fourth women’s gold medal in the last five Olympics, and it was 39-year-old April Ross’ third Olympic medal, but her first gold.

In the Four Hills Tournament in the Olympic season another teenager hit the headlines, as East Germany’s Jens Weißflog won the tournament after impressive jumping. Those two would dominate international ski jumping for the rest of the 1980s, and they had more in common: They were both extremely thin, with a body weight of around 54 kilograms. This represented the start of a trend, as in the following years a rising number of ski jumpers joined the international top class with a bodyweight below 60 kg.
In the Normal hill competition in Sarajevo, Nykänen was in the lead after the first round, producing a jump of 91.0 m with style points between 17 and 18.  Weißflog was in second, jumping one meter shorter than his Finnish rival. Another youngster, 20-year old Andreas Bauer of  West Germany, was in third place after a jump of 87.0 m, but well behind the two favorites. The competition was of mediocre quality, mostly due to unstable wind conditions.
In the second round, Stefan Stannarius from East Germany took an early lead after a good 89.5 m jump. Jari Puikkonen from Finland, Olympic bronze medalist in the large hill 1980 and runner-up in the World Championships 1982, made the best jump of the day, 91.5 m, and advanced from 21st place after the first round to the top of the leaderboard. Weißflog could do no more than 87.0 m, but took the lead, 3.4 points ahead of Puikkonen. Nykänen, jumping next-to last of the 58 competitors, could secure the Olympic gold with a decent jump of around 86 m, but he failed, landing at 84.0 m, and had to settle for silver, giving the gold to Weißflog. The reigning World champion on the Normal hill, Austrian Armin Kogler, had an extremely bad day, ending in 52nd place. The Olympic champion Jens Weißflog ended his extremely successful season by winning the Ski Jumping World Cup for the 1983/84-season.

Next for DeGale was his nemesis, Darren Sutherland of Ireland, who had won four of five previous bouts against DeGale. But he lost this one, DeGale winning 10-3 to move onto the finals. There he met Cuban Emilio Correa, 2007 Pan American Champion, and bronze medalist in this class at the 2005 Worlds.
The final was very close, with DeGale moving ahead early and holding on to win by a 16-14 decision. The margin was the two points Correa was penalized in the first round for biting. After the Olympics DeGale turned professional, posting a record of 12 wins and 1 loss thru April 2012. Correa’s silver medal continued the Cuban gold medal shutout in Beijing, as 2008 would mark the first time since 1968 that no Cuban won a boxing gold medal, as they won “only” four silvers and four bronzes.

Eight boarders bettered one minute, with Anderson’s teammate, Ross Rebagliati, in eighth at 59.87. Tied for second were Thomas Prugger (ITA) and Chris Klug (USA). The second run was marred by bad weather, with light snow and fog coming in, which caused the competition to be re-started for this run. When it was re-started Switzerland’s Ueli Kestenholz went off sixth and posted the fastest run of the round. Two boarders later, Rebagliati posted what would be the second fastest run in the second round, and moved into first place overall. He waited out the next seven boarders, and when Anderson struggled into 22nd place on the run, Rebagliati had the gold medal, with Prugger in second and Kestenholz third.
Or so it seemed. Three days later it was announced that Rebagliati would be stripped of his gold medal because he had tested positive for marijuana. This was immediately appealed by the Canadian Olympic Committee, and sent for a decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The ruling came down in Rebagliati’s favor, based on the fact that marijuana was considered a restricted substance, rather than a prohibited substance. The FIS explained that they had requested marijuana testing only for “fear related events” and not snowboarding. This was important, because snowboarders had somewhat of an alternative lifestyle, often with lots of partying, and marijuana was frequently present at the parties. Rebagliati explained that he had not recently been using, but had attended several parties at which there was a lot of marijuana use and he thought his positive was due to second-hand smoke. After the CAS ruling, Rebagliati was allowed to keep his gold medal.
Finishing in seventh place overall was Austrian Martin Freinademetz, who later had his Olympic Acceditation revoked. During a party at the Shiga Kogen Prince Hotel, he became quite drunk, and damaged a $4,000 switchboard. He offered to pay for the damage but the IOC was not amused.

Another challenger was Namibian Christine Mboma, who had dropped down from the 400 after World Athletics had not allowed her to compete in that event because of testosterone level abnormalities caused by a disorder of sexual development.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"In the inaugural women’s heavyweight freestyle wrestling event at the 2004 Summer Olympics Stanka Zlateva of Bulgaria finished last. By the 2012 Games she had five of the last six World Championship titles (2006-2011 except 2009), all the European Championships over the same period except for the most recent one, an Olympic silver medal from 2008, and was considered the overwhelming favorite for the crown in London. There were several secondary favorites in the tournament, including Wang Jiao, the defending Olympic Champion who had pinned Zlateva in the finals of the Beijing Games, but Wang had been unable to maintain this form on the international scene. Unlike in the other divisions, Japan was not considered a major threat for the crown as their entrant, Kyoko Hamaguchi, was already 34 and had a weak showing at the most recent World Championships. Still, with 10 medals from the World Championships stretching back to 1997, half of them gold, she could not be counted out.
With Zlateva and Wang ending up in opposite halves of the draw, many observers expected a rematch of the 2008 Olympic final. Wang was pinned in the semi-finals, however, by Russia’s Nataliya Vorobyova, whose best finish at a major international competition was third at the most recent European Championships. Vorobyova had also pinned Gyuzel Manyurova of Kazakhstan, the silver medalist from the 2004 Games, in the quarterfinals, who had in turn defeated Hamaguchi. In the final it seemed at first that Zlateva had the advantage, able to counter Vorobyova’s aggression and speed with raw strength and pushing the Russian out of the ring for a one point victory in the first period. Like a recurring nightmare, however, Zlateva found herself again pinned in an Olympic final, losing the gold medal by a fall for the second time. This gave Vorobyova the outstanding distinction of having pinned an Olympic champion and two Olympic runners-up in an Olympic tournament without ever having won a World Championships medal.
Having both been pinned by the eventual gold medalist, Manyurova and Wang met in the first bronze medal match in a rematch of the final from the 2011 Asian Championships, where the Kazakh had emerged victorious. They fought ferociously, each scoring one point in the first round, which was given to the Chinese competitor for having scored last. Wang pushed her opponent out of the ring in the second period and was leading the round until the final five seconds, when Manyurova was able to score three points in a last-ditch effort to extend the match into a third period. In the end, the medal was decided by luck: drawn into a par terre, Manyurova chose the red ball and was given the advantageous position, using it to score a single point that gave her the bronze. The final podium spot was contested between Vasilisa Marzalyuk of Belarus, runner-up at the most recent European Championships and bronze medalist at the 2005 edition as well as the 2011 World Championships, and Maider Unda of Spain, who had finished fifth in the 2008 Games and had bronze medals from the 2009 World Championships and the 2010 and 2012 European Championships. The duo was evenly matched, but Unda managed to get one point past the Belarusian in each round to win a second bronze at the impressive age of 35.

At Sydney, Greene confirmed his status as the world’s fastest man, winning easily in 9.87, with Boldon second. The bronze medal went to the Barbadian Obadele Thompson.

Nadal had recently won the French Open (as he always did) and Wimbledon, and had a 32-match winning streak that was ended at the Cincinnati Open, his final tournament before the Beijing Olympics. Both Federer and Nadal won their first three matches, but Federer was then upset by American James Blake in the quarter-finals. Blake then lost to Chile’s Fernando González in the semis in three sets, while Nadal advanced to the final with a difficult three-set win over Serbia’s Novak Đoković. Đoković was world ranked #3, but was not yet the dominant force in tennis that he would become in the next few years.
González was hoping to match his countryman, Nicolás Massú, who had won the Olympic singles gold in 2004, but the final was relatively easy for Nadal, who defeated González in straight sets, although it was not a runaway, winning 6-3, 7-6 (2), 6-3. The next day, Nadal advanced to become the #1 ranked player in the world, displacing Federer, who had been ranked #1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks. In the third-place match Đoković dispatched Blake with ease in straight sets to win the bronze medal.

54000,"Springboard, Men",1904 Summer Olympics,3,Diving,/editions/3/sports/DIV, 7 September 1904,"Life Saving Exhibition Lake, Forest Park, St. Louis",5 from 2 countries,na,na,"A diving competition was held at the life-saving exhibition lake in the middle of the World’s Fairgrounds on 7 September 1904, concurrent with the swimming events.  Only one event was held, a fancy diving competition on springboard.  A St. Louis doctor, Dr. George Sheldon, won the competition, defeating Germany’s Georg Hoffmann fairly easily.  The controversy in this event occurred in the battle for the bronze medal.  The American, Frank Kehoe, and a German, Alfred Braunschweiger, tied for third with 11.33 points.  The Germans protested this result, thinking that Braunschweiger had easily outperformed Kehoe.  A “dive-off” for third place was scheduled but Braunschweiger refused to compete and Kehoe was awarded the bronze medal.
The German commissioner to the World’s Fair, Dr. Theodore Lewald, had donated a trophy for the winning diver, but he was so incensed at the outcome that he refused to award it to Sheldon.  The controversy occurred because the Germans thought that they did fancier dives than the Americans, although the Americans protested that the Germans had poorer entries into the water.  The Germans, noting that the event was called a fancy diving contest, thought that was immaterial.  On 29 September, James Sullivan announced the ruling that the protest had not been allowed, although the decision had been made two weeks earlier. The Germans protested again, and this was, at first, overruled.  But two years later, the official result was announced as a tie for third place, although this was never accepted by the Americans, and the final result is disputed.
In many older sources this event is often described as a platform diving event, but that is incorrect. Photos show that it was held off a springboard, and diving historian Bob Clotworthy (1956 springboard gold medalist) has also maintained for several years that this was a springboard event.

Both fighters turned professional, with Roldán having an undistinguished career, winning three fights, losing two, with one draw, and retiring in 1973. But Robinson came to a sadder end. He won 11 of 13 professional fights through the end of 1970. While training in 1971 he collapsed into a coma, and never regained consciousness, dying three years later.

His team-mate Aleksandr Privalov was also considered among the favorites, winning the bronze medal in the 1960 Games and coming second in the World Championships 1961. The greatest threats to the Soviets were considered to be the Finns. Antti Tyrväinen had a habit of coming second in international championships, with silver medals both from the 1960 games and from the World Championships 1962 and 1963. The Finnish team also consisted of two interesting veterans. Hannu Posti, aged 38 and placing fourth in 5000 m track at the 1952 Helsinki Games, had taken up biathlon with success, placing third at the 1963 World Championships. Another interesting start was triple Olympic Gold medalist in cross country skiing, Veikko Hakulinen.

Both the finalists, Harry Blackstaffe and Alexander McCulloch, were champions of the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley - Blackstaffe winning in 1906 and McCulloch holding the title in 1908. One of the first round losers, Lou Scholes, was the top Canadian sculler and had won the Diamond Sculls in 1904. The only top scullers not present were Britain’s Fred Kelly, Henley Diamond champion in 1902-03 and 1905, but now retired as a sculler (he competed in the eights at 1908 Olympics), and America’s Frank Greer, U.S. champion in 1903-05 and 1908 and the 1904 Olympic champion.
In the qualifying rounds, Blackstaffe and McCulloch were not challenged at all. In the final, McCulloch, starting out of Bucks Station, took the early lead, but started by pulling fewer strokes than Blackstaffe. McCulloch opened up as much as 1 lengths and led through 1,200 yards before being caught by Blackstaffe. Shortly after 1 mile though, Blackstaffe had pulled ahead by 3/4 of a length, and McCulloch could not close the gap.
The silver and bronze medalists listed below are controversial. It seems likely that only gold medals, and no silver or bronze medals, were given. The rules, as given in the 1908 Official Report (p. 528), note, “The Winners or Winner of the events will each receive the British Olympic Council’s Gold Medal for the Olympic Games of 1908.”  And on another page of the 1908 Official Report (p. 37), one finds under Rowing, “Prizes: - Gold Olympic Medals to the winners in each Event.”  There is no mention of silver or bronze medals in either place. In the results section of the 1908 Official Report (p. 358). the four rowing events are listed, with only the winners listed under gold medals. No silver or bronze medal placements are listed.
Because of the set-up of the Henley course, only two crews or sculls competed at any one time. Thus the semi-finals and finals consisted of only two crews or single scullers. Certainly the losing finalist would seem to be considered the “silver medalist” although we do not know if those rowers actually received such a medal. In addition, it would seem natural, and consistent with other Olympic sports with head-to-head formats, such as boxing and tennis, to consider the losing semi-finalists as “bronze medalists.”
Olympic statisticians vary on the listing of these results. Erich Kamper, in Encyclopaedia of the Olympic Games, listed the losing semi-finalists in the single sculls and eights as finishing third, but he did not list the losing semi-finalists that way in the coxed pairs or coxed fours. Both Volker Kluge (Die Olympischen Spiele von 1896 bis 1980) and David Wallechinsky (The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics) consider all the losing semi-finalists as finishing in 3rd place. But in his more recent book, Olympische Sommerspiele: Die Chronik I, Kluge did not describe the losing semi-finalists as bronze medalists.
However, in keeping with our Guidelines (see Updates–>Guidelines), we have considered the losing finalists as silver medalists (2nd place) and both the losing semi-finalists as bronze medalists (3rd place). In those guidelines we note, “we consider all participants being placed first, second or third in the final standings to have received gold, silver or bronze medals respectively.”

But Gamba had little trouble, Dyot eventually submitting – twice, as the referee did not notice the first submission. Gamba made the final where he faced Korean An Byeong-Geun.

After having finished fourth at the 2008 Summer Games, missing out on bronze by nine seconds, she improved significantly and went on to win the 2010 World Cup and the 2011 World Championships. Going into the London Olympics ranked #1, she won the test event on the course, sealing her reputation as the favorite. In a sport as unpredictable as mountain biking, however, she would certainly not go unchallenged. Sabine Spitz of Germany, the defending Olympic champion and World Champion in 2003, was forty years old but had not slowed down and was well-prepared to defend her Olympic title. Poland’s Maja Włoszczowska, the 2010 World Champion and a silver medalist at both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, was not competing due to injury but Beijing’s Olympic bronze medalist and two-time World Champion Irina Kalentyeva of Russia was expected to mount a challenge to Pendrel as well. Finally there was hometown favorite Annie Last who, although never finishing better than eighth at a major international competition, had spent two years training as a senior rather than in the under-23 division in the hopes of being selected for the 2012 Summer Olympics. With the support of the sold-out, 20,000 strong crowd at the event, she could certainly not be counted out.
After the start Pendrel, Last, and Spitz helped form a four rider-strong lead group that included Julie Bresset of France, the most recent under-23 World Champion. These cyclists put some distance between themselves and the field behind in the beginning, but Pendrel and Last began to fade by the second lap and were eventually passed by American Georgia Gould, who came from around 16th position to 7th by the end of the first lap. Following a collision between Pendrel and Last, Bresset, Spitz, and Gould led the field and were never challenged. Bresset was usually in front of the trio, with Spitz and Gould exchanging podium positions until Spitz crashed on a technical section approximately halfway through the race, which forced Gould to stop. Bresset used the opportunity to break away and was all but assured the gold medal, which she claimed over a minute ahead of anyone else. Spitz and Gould were still far ahead of their closest competitors and, while Gould’s early charge from 16th to podium position eventually cost her energy, Spitz was able to use her experience to outmanoeuver her opponent and win silver a comfortable six seconds ahead of her American rival. Gould finished with the bronze medal, a respectable 33 seconds ahead of Kalentieva, who was fourth. Last and Pendrel faded to eighth and ninth respectively, certainly a disappointing finish for the overwhelming favorite in the race. Pendrel would, however, go on to win bronze in the event at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Their most serious rivals in the Cortina Olympics were supposed to be the Finns, their best being Paavo Korhonen and Eeti Nieminen.
In the opening ski jumping event Stenersen made his countrymen shaky with a bad first jump, placing him on a very modest 19th place after the first round. A totally unknown Soviet skier, Yury Moshkin, surprised everybody by taking a clear lead. In the second round, Moshkin fell after the longest jump of the day (79.5 m), but Stenersen regained confidence after achieving the highest point score of the round. In the third round Stenersen again mad a solid jump, but could not prevent Moshkin from winning the jumping competition with Stenersen and the 25 year old Swede Bengt Eriksson following closely as 2nd and 3rd. The other Norwegians, placing 10-15-26 seemed out of the medal contention, like Korhonen, placing 17.

Moshkin appeared to be no match at all, he was beaten by Stenersen by 8 minutes and fell down to 13th place in the final standing. Stenersen won with a large margin, but the struggle for the other medals was very close. Eriksson, later nicknamed “Silver-Bengt” for his Olympic achievement, held on for silver, and another great surprise, the 24-year old Pole Franciszek Gąsienica Groń was able to snatch the bronze medal ahead of Korhonen.

By the conclusion of the quarterfinals, it looked as if Italy would easily take the crown and, in the semifinals, they defeated Switzerland by 3.4 seconds, with a time of 6:43.4. The medal races, however, were unlike any other rowing event in Amsterdam. Instead of advancing to the final, Poland, who had essentially had a walkover in the semifinals, met Switzerland in a contest to determine who would face Italy. Switzerland emerged victorious and Poland settled for bronze. Unsurprisingly, the Swiss crew lost to the Italians again in the final, this time by a wider margin as they had not received the opportunity to rest that the Italian team had been afforded. Switzerland was therefore unable to defend its crown, settling for silver, while Italy became the new Olympic champion. They would also win the 1929 European Championships with the same crew.

Nor did the previous Olympic champions and runners-up, the United States and the Soviet Union, return with their victorious members. The Americans sent Ted Frost and Robert Rogers of Seattle’s Lake Washington Rowing Club, because they had won the event at the 1959 Pan American Games.

Some thought he was too much of a master at that, and rumors abounded that he one of the first to use blood doping to increase his endurance for the Olympics. This was never proven. In Montréal he had already defended his 10K gold medal. In the 5K final, Foster led for the first 2,000 metres when Virén went to the front.

The total score consisted of 50% of the team all-around score and the performances on all four apparatuses in the individual final. The defending champion was Nadia Comăneci, but there were chinks in her armor by 1980, as she had not won the World Championships in either 1978 or 1979 due to injury. The favorite in early 1980 was likely Soviet Yelena Mukhina who was the 1978 World Champion, missing the 1979 meet due to a broken leg. Sadly, a few weeks before the Moskva Olympics, Mukhina fell while training on floor exercise, broke her neck, and was rendered quadriplegic permanently. She would eventually die in 2006.
The contest for gold was very close between Comăneci, Soviet Yelena Davydova, and East German Maxi Gnauck. It all came down to the last rotation, with Gnauck leading but her vault scored only 9.70 points. Davydova then scored 9.95 on beam, and was followed by Comăneci on the same apparatus. She made a small stepback on landing, and it looked unlikely she would get the 9.95 she needed to win gold. The head judge was Romanian Marian Simionescu who disagreed with the judges’ scores and tried to get them to change them, arguing for 28 minutes before her complaint was disallowed. Simionescu refused to punch the final score into the computer which was done by a Soviet official while Simionescu continued her tirade. The 9.85 score gave Davydova the gold medal with Gnauck and Comăneci sharing silver.
This and the team all-around were Davydova’s only gold medals in Moskva, but she added a silver on beam in her only Olympics. Comăneci would win gold medals in 1980 on floor and beam, and ended her Olympic career with nine medals and five gold medals.

He had won the 100, long jump, and relay at the 1983 World Championships and was considered the greatest track & field athlete in the world in 1984. His biggest challenger was American Larry Myricks, who would likely have been favored in 1980, but lost his chance at Olympic gold because of the boycott. In the final, Lewis opened with 8.54 (28-0¼), and took only one more jump, which he fouled. He then kept passing, confident that his mark would hold up, which it did easily. But the fans in the Los Angeles Coliseum did not like this, booing Lewis and never warming to him at all during the Olympics. Non-knowledgable fans did not realize that Lewis was saving his legs for the remainder of his competitions. The silver medal went to Australia’s Gary Honey, the 1982 Commonwealth Games champion. He tied at 8.24 (27-0½) with Italy’s Giovanni Evangalisti but won silver because of his best second mark of 8.18 (26-10).

The shot was put from a two-metre square. Bob Garrett (USA) won with a throw of 11.22 metres. Miltiadis Gouskos (GRE) was second and Georgios Papasideris (GRE) was third. Garrett led from his first throw.  Gouskos’ best effort was on his last attempt and the Greek crowd cheered wildly, thinking he had beaten Garrett. The Greek crowd was very disappointed, especially when the official posting the scores made an error and initially listed Gouskos as the winner. The error was quickly corrected.
The distances were well off George Gray’s (CAN) world record of 14.32, but George Robertson, a British athlete who competed in the discus throw, noted that this was due to the size of the square, which “corresponded with no known rules, although the event was purported to be held under English rules.”

They were mixed, with both men and women participating. The events all took place starting at the Aerostation at the Parc de Vincennes in Paris. This was the all-around competition for ballooning at the 1900 Paris Exposition, with points awarded to balloonists based on their performance in each of the separate events. The winner was Henry, Count de la Vaulx, who competed in 19 balloon events, and totaled 5,080 points, from a maximum possible of 9,000, well ahead of Jacques Balsan, who had 4,360 points. Count de la Vaulx won five separate events, including three for longest distance traveled. Balsan won four separate events, two for longest distance traveled, and two for greatest heights achieved. For winning the Grand Prix de l’Aeronautique, Count de la Vaulx was given a gold plaque valued at 1,000 francs.
Count de la Vaulx was considered the pioneer of aeronautics in France and was a co-founder of the Aero Club de France in 1898. Later in October 1900, he and Georges Castillon de Saint-Victor set a distance record for most distance travelled by balloon, covering just over 1,925 km (1,195 miles) from Vincennes to Korostychev, near Kyiv, Ukraine in 35¾ hours. He was given the Grand Medal of the Aero Club de France for his contributions to aviation and in 1905 Count de la Vaulx co-founded and became a director of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).

358639,"Marathon, Men",2016 Summer Olympics,59,Athletics,/editions/59/sports/ATH,21 August 2016 — 9:30,"Sambódromo, Rio de Janeiro",155 from 79 countries,"42,195 metres (26 miles, 385 yards) point-to-point.",na,"Kenya’s Eliud Kipchoge had once been a premier track runner, primarily over 5,000 metres, winning gold in that event at the 2003 World Championships, silver medals at the 2008 Olympics and 2007 Worlds, and a bronze at the 2004 Olympics. After failing to make the 2012 Kenyan Olympic team, he moved to the road and quickly became almost unbeatable at the marathon. From 2013-16 he won six major city marathons, winning all except the 2013 Berlin Marathon, and breaking 2-05 four times. He came to Rio as a clear favorite, but Olympic marathon favorites have not usually fared well.
The heat and humidity on the last day of the Olympics kept the pace slow, as is usual in the Olympic marathon. At 30K Kipchoge picked up the pace and strung out the field, leaving only two runners by his side with 10 km remaining, American Galen Rupp, silver medallist in the London 10K, who had only run his first marathon at the US Olympic Trials, and Ethiopian Feyisa Lilesa. Kipchoge surged again at 35K and Rupp could not maintain the pace, with Lilesa struggling to stay close. With 6 km remaining Kipchoge was alone, the gold medal decided if disaster did not strike. It did not and the Kenyan won the gold by 1:10 over Lilesa, who was 11 seconds ahead of Rupp, who was closing the margin, but ran out of ground.
In early May 2017, Kipchoge ran a trial race, staged by Nike, in an attempt to break the 2-hour barrier for the marathon. The two other participants in the race were Ethiopian Lelisa Desisa and Eritrean Zersenay Tadesse. The event was held on the Monza race track in Italy, with designated pacers entering the event planned stages. The runners ran behind a pace vehicle, designed to keep them on the ideal pace, but it also provided drafting protection, one of the factors keeping the event from being eligible for record consideration. Drinks were handed to the runners, as needed, by helpers on bicycles, another move that made it ineligible for a record. Finally, all three marathoners wore newly designed, special Nike shoes, and there was some question about their legality for record purposes. In the end, only Kipchoge came close to the barrier, running a “fastest on record” time of 2-00:25, although it was not considered for a world best time, because of the problems noted above.
By the late 2010s Kipchoge had stamped himself as the dominant marathoner in the world and many considered him the greatest ever, perhaps rivalled only by Abebe Bikila. From 2013-19 Kipchoge ran 13 marathons, winning all but the 2013 Berlin race, in which he finished second. At Berlin in 2018 he set a world record of 2-01:39, and in 2019, at the London Marathon, his winning time of 2-02:37 was the second fastest marathon ever.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"The face of women’s wrestling in America, Adeline Gray, came to Rio having dominated the last Olympic cycle, winning the last two World Championships in 75 kg. With three World titles in total (2012, 2014, 2015), Gray’s last defeat in a World Championship match was in 2013 to Zhang Fengliu of China, who went on to win that year’s title but had struggled since then. Gray was favoured to become the first American woman to win an Olympic wrestling gold medal.
Not to be discounted was the experienced two-time Olympic medalist Gyuzel Manyurova of Kazakhstan (2004 silver, 2012 bronze). Also fancied was Canada’s Erica Wiebe, who arrived in Rio world-ranked No. 2, despite just a handful of Grand Prix wins, and had yet to reach the podium at the World Championships.
Gray went out of the competition much earlier than expected when “something” was missing in her quarter-final match against Vasilisa Marzalyuk of Belarus who Gray has dominated in the past, but lost 4-1 on this occasion.
Ultimately, it was the rookie (Wiebe) and the veteran (Manyurova) who would meet in the gold medal match. The Canadian Wiebe, in her Olympic début, did not concede a single point in either the semi-final or final. She dominated the 38-year old Kazakh Manyurova, winning by a score of 6-0, after beating Marzalyuk, Zhang and Germany’s Maria Selmaier earlier in the day. Canada has never missed the podium since women’s wrestling made its Olympic début in Athens in 2004. With this Olympic title, Wiebe followed in the footsteps of her countrywomen, two-time Olympic medalist Carol Huynh, (2008 gold, 2012 bronze) and three-time Olympic medalist Tonya Verbeek (2004 and 2012 silvers, 2008 bronze).
Bronze medals went to Zhang, who defeated Wiebe’s semi-final opponent Marzalyuk 8-4 in the first of the bronze medal matches, while the other went to Yekaterina Bukina of Russia who defeated Laure Ali of Cameroon 5-3, thus depriving of Cameroon of their first ever wrestling medal, male or female.

Camplin was herself returning from major knee reconstructive surgery in 2005. The event had to be postponed two days because of heavy snow.
In the qualifying round, Cooper had the best score on both runs, and her total of 213.56 was a world best score for women’s aerials. In the first run of the final, the three leaders were all Chinese, with Li in second place, behind Guo Xinxin leading, and the 1998 Olympic silver medalist, Xu Nannan, in third. Camplin was in fourth, and Leu fifth, while Cooper could not repeat her qualifying success, and would eventually place eighth, falling on both of her jumps. In the second round, Leu had by far the best run, with her back full-full-full, and moved up to win the gold medal. Li held onto second place, while Camplin moved up to a bronze medal, with Xu dropping down to fourth.

The only other returning Olympic medalist was runner-up Hans Wetterström, who was also accompanied by a new partner, Carl-Gunnar Sundin. Wetterström and Sundin were also half of the silver medal-winning K-4 10000 crew at the 1954 World Championships. The reigning World Champions were Herbert Wiedermann and Max Raub of Austria, but they attempted to improve their results in the K-2 1000 from 1952, in which they had won bronze, and thus their nation was represented by Alfred Schmidtberger and Hermann Salzner. Reigning World bronze medalist Germany sent Fritz Briel and Theo Kleine. Much of the race was a battle between a leading group of four crews, Sweden, Germany, Hungary’s János Urányi and László Fábián, and Australia’s Dennis Green and Walter Brown but, as the finish line approached, the Swedes dropped back while Germany and Hungary went neck and neck towards the end. The Hungarians managed a slight advantage and won gold, leaving silver for the Germans and a surprise bronze medal for the Australians.

Despite this dominance, the Netherlands only once captured Olympic gold, in 2014. For Beijing, the Dutch were once again favored, but with ageing great Sven Kramer and Marcel Bosker they had two riders without any great individual performances at the Olympics. In addition, other nations had pioneered team pursuit tactics, including pushing the skater in front of you (allowing for better aerodynamics and transfer of speed) as well as choosing not to switch the leading skater. In recent World Cups, the United States had been particularly successful with these tactics, winning twice and bettering the world record. Defending champions Norway were also favored, although their top skater, Sverre Lunde Pedersen, had only barely recovered from a horrific cycling crash in the summer of 2021, which had left him with severe leg, neck and liver injuries.
Two of the favorites met in the quarter-finals. The Norwegians led the entire race, but only narrowly held off the US, which finished only 0.04 behind. With 3:37.47, Norway recorded the fastest qualifying time. The Dutch set the third time, while ROC took the final semi spot. That was slightly surprising, as they had only qualified for the Games by time (not performances).
As in 2018, Norway knocked out the Netherlands in the semi-finals, by a clear margin. The other semi-final was a much closer affair. ROC got off to a quick start, but the US were even again halfway. The ROC skaters then pulled away slightly towards an impressive 3:36.62, the best time ever recorded at sea level and an Olympic Record.
Despite setting the second fastest time of the tournament, this left the Americans to fight for bronze, which they easily claimed against the Netherlands. This left the Dutch medal-less for the first time in the event, while the Americans saw former inline speed skating great Joey Mantia finally claim his first Olympic medal at his third Games.
In the final, ROC seemed to have spent all their energy in the semi-finals. Trailing by 0.24 after half a lap already, they never came closer, making Norway the first repeat champions in the event, although Pedersen was the only skater to race on both victorious teams.

In between Olympics Hungary had been successful in team competition at the World Championship although the Soviets had provided the individual champions in 1970 and 1971. Csaba Fenyvesi was 29-years-old in München and had been a member of the champion Hungarian teams without achieving individual medal success at major championships.
Ironically the deciding bout of the competition was one where Csaba Fenyvesi of Hungary and Jacques Ladègaillerie were tied in their bout at the end of regulation time and were accorded a double loss, with a 5-5 score.. Had Ladègaillerie won he would have matched the Hungarian’s win-loss but the tie consigned him to win silver behind Fenyvesi. Defending champion Kulcsár won bronze.
One of the favorites sadly did not fare well. West German Rudi Maier had won the 1971 Heidenheim Pokal, considered the Wimbledon of fencing, and was the first German to win it in 15 years. He had also placed seventh at the 1971 World Championships. In pool four in München, he drew Ladègaillerie in his first match and was leading, 3-1, when, as Maier walked back to the en garde line, he collapsed and lost consciousness. Maier was rushed to the hospital but was rendered quadriplegic from uncertain causes, although a blood clot on the brain was suspected. Maier never regained much function and was permanently confined to a wheelchair.

Only USA wrestling aficionados considered the American entrant in the class, with the unusual name of Gable Steveson, the surname often misspelled as Stevenson. Steveson was born to be a wrestler, as he was named for American wrestling icon Dan Gable, and had just finished his junior year in college at the University of Minnesota, winning the NCAA title shortly before the USA Olympic Trials. Steveson had no significant international record at the senior level.
The opening round saw the first surprise as Batirmuzaev was beaten on fall by German Gennadij Cudinovic. Petriashvili was moving steadily towards the final as Steveson also surprised the #3 seed, Turkey’s Taha Akgul, in the quarter-finals, winning on points, 8-0.
Petriashvili and Steveson won their semis to meet in the final, where Steveson went out to an early lead, 4-0. Petriashvili came back strongly and went ahead, 8-5, with 1:30 left in the match, which held until only 10 seconds remained, when Steveson scored a takedown to make it 8-7.

Ria and Peter married in 1951. They were also World and European champions in roller figure skating.
Ria and Peter Falk was favored for the gold medal in Oslo, and they did not disappoint their fans. This mature, elegant and creative pair was unbeaten as amateurs. At the Oslo Games Ria was 29 and Peter 30. They were the first pair showing side by side double jumps and the Lasso lift.

Paul Kennedy, apparently frustrated, assaulted a press photographer after their performance, and was suspended by both ISU and his national governing body.

With the restrictions on competitors lifted in 1952 the same Swedish team returned and did win the gold medal in Helsinki, and they would also win again, with the exact same team members, in 1956 at Stockholm. Switzerland took the silver medal, with Germany winning bronze. One of the German members was Heinz Pollay who had won the individual dressage gold medal in 1936 at Berlin.

There have been World Tumbling Championships contested by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) since 1999, and World Championships were contested from 1976-98 by the International Trampoline Federation (ITF), which was formed in 1965. Tumbling has also been contested at the World Games since 1981. In the United States, national championships were first held in 1886, and were continuous through 1968, at which time they were stopped. However, the United States Trampoline & Tumbling Association later reinstated tumbling nationals, sometime around 1971.
There were only four competitors in 1932 Olympic tumbling, which consisted of a compulsory and voluntary routine, with each routine lasting from 2-3 minutes. Three of the gymnasts were Americans and they won all the medals, led by Rowland Wolfe, who performed a backflip with two twists. The silver went to Ed Gross with Bill Hermann winning bronze, and Hungarian István Pelle, the all-around runner-up, placing a distant fourth, in an event which was likely strange to him.

The other half of the draw was more predictable although the defeat of #2 seeds Russia by #3 seeds China would have been considered a minor upset if the recent form of both nations fencers were not taken into consideration.
The final saw Sun Yujie make up for the disappointment of failing to win the individual gold by anchoring China to victory by 39 points to 25. This was the first time an Asian nation had won an Olympic team title in fencing although, as South Korea were to win the men’s sabre title within the hour, its status as a unique feat in Olympic history would not last for long.
The bronze medal match between the USA and Russia was a much closer affair which was decided only when Courtney Hurley scored the winning hit in the sudden death extra minute.

The fifth skier off was France’s Franck Piccard, the bronze medalist in the downhill who had been named after Frank Sinatra. Piccard was initially angry with his time, feeling he had made several mistakes late in the run, but as the remaining seeded skiers came down, his time held up and he had the first Olympic gold medal in the super-G. Zurbriggen had an unusually poor performance for him, finishing tied for fifth. The silver medal went to Austrian Helmut Mayer, who had won one previous World Cup race, a giant slalom in 1987.

Three members of their team competed in PyeongChang: Linn Persson, Mona Brorsson, and Hanna Öberg. The team was completed with Hanna’s younger sister Elvira Öberg. The ROC team took the silver medal with Germany taking the bronze.
The first German runner, Vanessa Voigt, did a good job and gave a courageous performance in what was her first World Cup season and Winter Olympics début. Voigt handed over as the leader, ahead of Sweden (0.5 seconds) and Italy (1.5 seconds). On the second leg, Vanessa Hinz had to reload twice for the last shot of the standing shooting and dropped to fourth place. Kristina Reztsova was first at the second exchange for the ROC with Italy’s Dorothea Wierer in second place.
Despite reloading four times, Hanna Öberg took the lead on the third leg. Italy’s youngest competitor, Samuela Comola, held on to second place. Svetlana Mironova had to go a penalty loop and dropped to third place. Germany started in fourth place, 45.9 seconds behind. Franziska Preuß, who could not compete for about two months prior to the Games due to an injury and COVID-19 infection, maintained their fourth place.
Elvira Öberg started the anchor leg with a lead of 26 seconds, and the Swede secured the gold medal, reloading just once in the final standing shooting. Federica Sanfilippo for Italy lost almost 90 seconds to the top teams and fell out of the medal ranking, finishing fifth. Uliana Nigmatullina had to reload just once, and took silver for the ROC. Olympic champion Denise Herrmann, Germany’s final runner, could never close the gap but was happy with bronze.
Heavy favourites Norway lost all chances early in the race, when their second runner, Tiril Eckhoff had to go two penalty loops and added 1:40 to Norway’s deficit, which was too much for the last two competitors to claw back.

Though Soviet skaters had not competed internationally prior to 1953, Grishin had competed at the Worlds and Europeans in 1954 and 1955, and won all the 500 m distances except for the 1955 Worlds. Only six days before this event was held, Grishin skated in a pre-Olympic meet on the Misurina rink and shattered the world record with 40.2, bettering the previous record by 6/10ths of a second. That mark of 40.8 had been set by Yury Sergeyev, who had recorded it in January 1955 at Medeo, and Sergeyev was in Cortina to compete. The event started at noon and Grishin was in the first pair. When he finished in 40.2, equaling his world record, the gold medal was decided as nobody would get close to him. Sergeyev was in the second pair and finished in 41.1, which would eventually land him in fourth place. The other medals would eventually be won by Soviet skater Rafael Grach in second place, but 6/10ths behind Grishin, and Norwegian Alv Gjestvang, who won bronze. Gjestvang won his medal despite a near fall during the race. Both were quite unknown prior to 1956 outside their own nations, never having competed internationally before. But both would prove to be good sprinters, Grach returning to win a bronze in the 500 at the 1960 Olympics and Gjestvang winning a silver in the event in 1964. Gjestvang would also finish third in the event at the 1956 and 1959 World Championships.
Yevgeny Grishin would win another gold in Cortina two days later in the 1,500 metres. At Squaw Valley in 1960 he would return and repeat his gold medal victories in both events, though strangely, both 1,500 m gold medals were shared. During his career he set seven world records, all at distances 1,500 metres or shorter. His world records of 40.2 set in Misurina would last until 27 January 1963, when he broke them at Medeo, and in the process became the first skater to race 500 metres in under 40 seconds, finishing in 39.6. The next day, he bettered that with 39.5, his final world record.

The glamorous Eleanor Holm of the USA, who held the world record, and the woman whose record Holm had broken, Bonnie Mealing from Woolloomooloo, Australia. Holm attacked the field from the start of the final and was still gaining on the field at the finish to head Mealing by two seconds. Eleanor Holm was one of the most glamorous and controversial female sporting figured of the nineteen-thirties. In 1933 she married the popular singer and bandleader, Art Jarrett, and for a while combined her swimming with performances alongside her husband’s band.  Despite her marriage, she continued competing and qualified for the 1936 Berlin Olympics but her attempt to retain her title ended before she even reached European soil. Two days out of New York she was invited to a party thrown in honour of the journalists travelling with the Olympic team. Holm was seen drinking champagne until the early hours and was warned by team officials about her conduct. The breaking point came when the ship was docked at Cherbourg, Holm spent the day at several champagne parties and was discovered on deck by the team chaperone the worse for drink, and accompanied by a man, at ten thirty in the evening. Returned to her cabin, she proceeded to shout obscenities out of the porthole. The chaperone then returned with the team doctor, who was unable to wake her and diagnosed her as being in a state of “acute alcoholism”. In the morning Holm woke to the news that she had been removed from the Olympic team and despite taking her case to USOC president Avery Brundage, she would not compete in Berlin.
She did however report on the Games for the International News Agency and was an honoured guest of the German organisers. On her return to America she turned professional, divorced Art Jarrett and soon married Billy Rose, in whose Aquacade spectaculars she would star. A brief dalliance with Hollywood saw her co-star with Glenn Morris  in “Tarzan’s Revenge” but that was to be her only acting appearance. She hit the headlines one more time due to scandalous divorce proceedings with Billy Rose before settling to a third and longer lasting marriage.

350374,"Ice Hockey, Women",2014 Winter Olympics,58,Ice Hockey,/editions/58/sports/IHO,8 – 20 February 2014,"Ledovyi Dvorets Bolshoy, Coastal Cluster, Adler / Ledovaya Arena Shayba, Coastal Cluster, Adler",158 from 8 countries,"Round-robin pool, followed by classification matches.",na,"As had been the case since women’s hockey made its Olympic debut in 1998, Canada and the United States were the heavy favorites and the best-ranked teams in the world by a significant margin. The Canadians had the last three Olympic gold medals under their belt and were the 2012 world champions. The United States, meanwhile, were the 2011 and 2013 world champions. Below them in the rankings were Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, and Russia (who qualified as hosts), while Japan and Germany earned their tickets to the Games at the 2013 Olympic Qualification Tournament.
Responding to criticism that women’s hockey was not competitive enough, a format change was introduced wherein the top four teams were placed in Group A, while the remaining nations were sent to Group B. The top two teams from Group B would face the bottom two from Group A in the quarterfinals, while the bottom two of Group B were eliminated. This had several important ramifications. Firstly, the system succeeded in its intended effect and the double-digit shutouts or near-shutouts that characterized round robin play in 2010 were avoided; only one match was won by a margin greater than five goals. Secondly, Switzerland, who failed to win a single game in Group A, advanced to the final round and managed to progress to the semifinals by defeating Russia , the Group B winner. Perhaps most importantly, however, this new format meant that Canada and the United States met in the group stage at the Olympics for the first time since 1998, when there was only one main pool.
To no one’s surprise, Canada and the United States came out on top in their round robin pool, with Canada besting the Americans 3-2 in their match. Group B was won by Russia and Sweden, the latter of whom defeated Finland in the quarterfinals to meet the United States, against whom they lost 6-1. Switzerland, meanwhile, challenged Canada and held them to a 3-1 win, the smallest margin of victory for Canada against a non-American team at the Olympics. Determined to prove that this was no fluke, Switzerland defeated Sweden in the bronze medal match 4-3 (coming back from a 2-0 deficit), a considerable result for a nation that had failed to win a single match in the round robin and earned its first and only world championship medal, bronze, in 2012. It also became only the fifth nation (after the United States, Canada, Finland, and Sweden) to win an Olympic medal in women’s hockey.
The main matchup, however, was for the gold medal, and it went down as one of the best hockey matches – male or female – of all time. Unlike the 2010 Winter Olympics, which was decided in the first period, the 2014 edition was scoreless until over halfway into the second period, when Meghan Duggan of the United States drew first blood. The third period began poorly for the Canadians, who succumbed to Alex Carpenter (daughter of NHL standout Bobby Carpenter) after two minutes and, with less than five minutes to go, it seemed that the American victory was assured. In a surprising twist, however, Brianne Jenner and Marie-Philip Poulin undertook back-to-back drives (the latter with an empty Canadian net) and tied the game, drawing the two rival nations into sudden death overtime. After eight tense minutes, Poulin, who had secured Canada’s victory in Vancouver, repeated this feat in Sochi and scored during a brief interval of double power play. In less than 15 minutes, the Canadians had come back from certain defeat to dazzling victory and earned their 19th straight win in Olympic matches. Having also taken the curling tournament earlier in the day, Canada’s women celebrated their status as Olympic champions in both of their national winter sports. Hayley Wickenheiser and Jayna Hefford had additional cause to celebrate: not only were they participating in their fifth Olympics (having appeared in every women’s tournament since they began in 1998), but they also won their fifth Olympic medal, a record for either men’s or women’s hockey.  Caroline Ouellette, meanwhile, joined them in receiving a record fourth ice hockey gold medal (again, for men and women), having participated in every tournament since 2002.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
Although they finished only sixth originally, the Russian team was disqualified in December 2017 after eight separate members of the team – Inna Dyubanok, Yekaterina Lebedeva, Yekaterina Pashkevich, Anna Shibanova, Yekaterina Smolentseva, Galina Skiba, Tatyana Burina, and Anna Shchukina – were implicated in the Oswald Commission findings. However, after appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the sanctions against Lebedeva, Pashkevich, Burina, Shchukina, and Smolentseva were annulled, but the team remained disqualified because of the sanctions that were upheld.

The last five AAA titles in steeplechase had been won by Arthur Russell (1904-06), Joseph English (1907), and Reginald Noakes (1908).  Noakes would later win the 1909 and 1911 AAA titles and English won again in 1910.  English competed at the 1908 Olympics but did not finish the second heat.  Noakes did not compete due to injury.

Finally there was Nicolae Juravschi and Victor Reneischi, who had won the C-2 500 and 1000 for the Soviet Union at the 1988 Games, but had been denied the opportunity to defend their crown under the banner of the Soviet successor “Unified Team” (Juravschi, however, was eventually given the chance to compete for Romania). At the 1996 Olympics, however, they were representing Moldova together and were eager to race once more.
Hungary, Moldova, and Romania won their opening heats, while Bulgaria came in third in Juravschi and Reneischi’s heat, behind Andreas Dittmer and Gunar Kirchbach of Germany, the 1993 and 1995 World bronze medalists. Maseykov and Dovgalyonok, meanwhile, were relegated to the repêchage by Horváth and Kolonics. Moldova was runner-up to Romania in the first semi-final heat, while Hungary, Germany, Belarus, and Bulgaria finished in that order in the other heat. Hungary led for much of the final and, although they were eventually overtaken by Moldova, they managed a comeback in the last few meters and won the gold medal by 0.036 seconds. Thus Juravschi and Reneischi took silver while Romania came in soon after for bronze, having staved off a challenge from Germany by 0.424 seconds. This was Horváth and Kolonics’ second medal of the regatta, as they had taken bronze in the C-2 1000 the day before.

At the start of the season, she had lowered defending champion Bonnie Blair’s world record to 37.90, becoming the first woman to beat 38 seconds in the 500 m. She lowered it a few times more to 37.55 in December 1997. Weeks before the Olympics, Le May Doan won the distance twice at the World Sprint Championships, also grabbing the overall title. She had also won five of the six World Cup races that season, the only other victory being claimed by fellow Canadian Susan Auch. Some of the top racers from the previous season had trouble adapting to the new clap skate, such as 1997 World Champion Xue Ruihong, who would fare no better than 14th at the Olympics.
Two heats were being run at the Olympics for the first time, but this did not affect the results, with both runs having the exact same top three. Catriona Le May Doan won the first run as expected, but her lead over Auch was just 0.03 seconds, and the time was somewhat slower than expected (38.39). Third behind the two Canadians was home skater Tomomi Okazaki, beloved with the crowd for her smile. The gap to the fourth skater, Kyoko Shimazaki, was substantial, and the medals appeared decided already.
The next day, nothing changed. 1997 world bronze medalist Franziska Schenk moved up to 4th place, while Okazaki replicated her first day race to stay in third. In the final pair, Auch and Le May faced each other. As always, Auch had the better start of the two, but Le May the better full lap, now beating Auch by 3 tenths of a second.

He had won Olympic gold medals in 1928 and 1924, a World Championship in 1922, and European titles in 1925, 1930, and 1931. His biggest challenger was expected to be German Georg Gehring, who had won European Championships in 1926 and 1929. In the second round Gehring defeated Westergren and the way seemed clear for him. But Gehring was then defeated by Czechoslovakia’s Josef Urban, which eliminated the German with five bad points. As Westergren had defeated the two remaining wrestlers, Urban and Austrian Nikolaus Hirschl, Urban’s victory over Gehring made Westergren the first Olympic wrestler to win three gold medals.
Urban defeated Hirschl by fall to win the silver medal. Hirschl also won a bronze medal in heavyweight freestyle in Los Angeles. Urban had competed at the European Championships since 1926, winning one silver and two bronze medals, but the 1932 Olympics were his last major international. Westergren competed internationally for one more year, winning a bronze medal at the 1933 Europeans.

Ryun was no longer the dominant runner he had been in 1966-67 and was actually pushed as the top American by Marty Liquori, who had the top time in the world for 1,500 metres in 1971. But Liquori injured his leg and could not even contest the US Olympic Trials. Also a top miler 1972 was Kenyan Ben Jipcho, who had sacrificed himself in the 1968 final to help Keino win gold. He was no longer considered simply a domestique for Keino, but he too was injured and did not compete at München. A few weeks after the US Olympic Trials, Ryun ran 3:52.8, the third fastest mile ever, showing his fitness. The Olympic 1,500 would have three rounds. Ryun and Keino were drawn in the fourth heat of round one. Keino ran near the front, as he often did, while Ryun was in the back of the pack. At 1,000 metres, Ryun’s heel was clipped by Ghana’s Billy Fordjour, and both fell to the track. Ryun got up a few seconds later but was hopelessly behind and did not qualify for the semi-final. As he crossed the line, Keino met him and tried to console him. The US Olympic Committee appealed, claiming Ryun was tripped, but it was not allowed and he was out of the competition.
In the final the way seemed open for Keino to defend his gold medal. Among the 10 finalists, his main competition seemed to be New Zealander Rod Dixon, and the erratic Finlander, Pekka Vasala. His teammate, Mike Boit, also qualified but he was better known as an 800 runner. The pace in the final was slow, but Keino moved to the lead just after 700 metres. He then fired off a 55.1 lap, trying to break down the other runners, but they stayed in contact, the slow early pace leaving them plenty of run. Off the final curve, Vasala moved to Keino’s shoulder and outsprinted him to win the upset gold medal. Keino placed second with Dixon getting the bronze medal.

Unlike Helsinki this was not a Hungarian sweep of the medals as the champions of 1948 and 1952, Aladár Gerevich and Pál Kovács respectively, faltered in the final pool. The nation’s tradition was instead upheld by Rudolf Kárpáti who was competing as an individual for the first time after winning team gold in 1948 and 1952. Kárpáti’s six victories out of seven in the pool was one more than the total achieved by Poland’s Jerzy Pawłowski who took silver. The bronze medal was won, after a barrage, by Lev Kuznetsov who became the Soviet Union’s first individual fencing medallist.
The lives of the gold and silver medallists were to go in vastly different ways. Kárpáti returned to Hungary, unlike many of his team mates, and flourished under the new government. He retained his Olympic title in 1960 then, in retirement, rose to become head of the national fencing federation.
Pawłowski, a major in the Polish Army, would win gold 12 years later in Mexico but was later revealed to be working for the CIA. After the discovery of his espionage he spent 12 years in prison.

In the repêchage, of course, there was no one to challenge Killick and Southgate, so they advanced to the final, but dropped out prior to the start due to injury.

The squad featured top players like Hulk, Marcelo and Neymar along with a host of talents, several of which had played when Brazil won the 2011 U-20 World Cup. Their chief opponents were expected to be Spain. They had won the European qualifier, their senior team had just won Euro 2012, and a few of those players also competed at the Olympics: Javi Martínez, Juan Mata and Jordi Alba. Other contenders were the unknown British team – composed of English and Welsh players, featuring veteran star Ryan Giggs – and Mexico, which had placed third at the 2011 U-20 Worlds (runner-up Portugal didn’t qualify). Four teams débuted at the Olympics: Belarus, Gabon, Senegal and United Arab Emirates.
The biggest surprise of the preliminaries was the elimination of Spain, which lost twice and drew once. The other favorites did proceed to the quarter-finals, where the hosts lost to South Korea on penalties. Brazil won 3-2 over tiny Honduras after being 1-2 down, while Mexico needed extra time against Senegal. The fourth semi-finalist was Japan, which ousted Egypt.
Both Japan and Mexico had only once before reached the semi-final stage of an Olympic football tournament, both in 1968, when the Japanese beat Mexico for the bronze. This time, the Central Americans proceeded despite an early lead through Japan’s Yuki Otsu. South Korea, first-time Olympic semi-finalist, was too weak for the Brazilians, who proceeded into their third Olympic final.
Brazil was heavily favored for the gold, but the Mexicans delivered a sensitive blow only 28 seconds into the game, when Oribe Peralta struck after a defensive error. The Brazilians dominated most of the match, but were unable to seriously threaten the Mexican defense. With 15 minutes left on the clock, Peralta headed in a free kick to all but clinch the title. Hulk scored a late goal to lift the hopes of the Brazilian fans for a few minutes.
The bronze medal match saw South Korea beat Japan 2-0. Amid the celebrations, Korean player Park Jong-Wu held up a banner he received, stating “Dokdo is our territory” – referring to the Liancourt Rocks dispute between the two nations. As the IOC does not permit athletes to make political statements, Park was immediately banned from the medal ceremony. He was later fined and banned for two matches by FIFA, and initially did not receive his Olympic medal. In February 2013 the IOC Executive Board voted to censure Park with a strong warning for inappropriate behavior, but informed the Korean Olympic Committee to deliver a bronze medal to Park “as long as it done without fanfare or publicity of any kind”.
Earlier, the Korean team was also involved in another controversy. Following his team’s loss to South Korea, Swiss player Michel Morganella called the Koreans a “bunch of mentally handicapped retards” on Twitter, for which he was promptly expelled from the team by his coach.

The defending champion, Turkey’s Nurcan Taylan, competed in Beijing but missed all three attempts in the snatch and was eliminated. She kissed the discs on the left side of her barbell as she left the lifting platform.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended.

This was one of the many events affected. Of note, every women’s weightlifting event from the 2008 Beijing Olympics was affected by positive re-tests for PEDs.

This ruling caused several European countries to withdraw their entries, and most South American teams forfeited as well.

The most notable match, however, was another quarter- final, Peru v Austria. The match saw Peru come from 0-2 behind to win the match 4-2 after extra time. But the contest was marred by rough play from both sides, and in overtime several Peruvian spectators stormed the field and held the Austrian players.

Hungary’s György Kozmann and György Kolonics, the latter of whom was a 1996 Olympic champion, were the reigning European champions.

The opening heats, however, were won by Germany’s Christian Gille and Tomasz Wylenzek, the 2002 European bronze medalists, and China’s Meng Guanliang and Yang Wenjun, who had allegedly only entered the Games to practice for future competitions. They, along with the Cuban and the Polish crews, who were runners-up in China’s heat and third in Germany’s heat respectively, advanced directly to the finals. Hungary and Romania, who had been fourth in Germany and China’s heats respectively, were sent to the semi-final, in which the latter defeated the former. The final was an incredibly tight race in which everyone except the final duo, Poland, crossed within 0.932 seconds of each other. After sorting out the chaos, it was determined that China had taken a surprise gold medal, its first of any color in Olympic canoeing, while Cuba had been runner-up by 0.072 seconds and Russia’s Aleksandr Kostoglod and Aleksandr Kovalyov, the 2001 European runners-up, had taken bronze 0.092 seconds later. This was not Kostoglod and Kovalyov’s first medal of the regatta, as they had taken silver in the C-2 1000 the day before.

This allowed Mexican Guillermo García to advance to the final of the 1,500, although had originally place ninth in the heats. In the final Burton went out fast and took the lead on the first lap, but Australia’s Graham Windeatt stayed close and took the lead back at 800 metres, increasing it to 1½ bodylengths by 1,000 metres. His pace was almost suicidal as at 900 metres he was six seconds ahead of DeMont’s world record pace, allowing Burton to gradually cut into Windeatt’s lead, pulling ahead at 1,300 metres, and increasing the lead to four full bodylengths at the finish, six seconds behind. American Doug Northway came in well back for the bronze medal. García finished last in the final. Burton finished in 15:52.58 to narrowly better DeMont’s world record.

She had rarely lost since Vancouver but after winning the 2013 World Championship, took a sabbatical and came to Sochi somewhat untested of late. If she did not win, the Russian crowd looked to 15-year-old hyper-flexible wunderkind Yuliya Lipnitskaya, who had recently won the European Championship and Skate Canada and had wowed the crowd with her performance during the team trophy competition in Sochi. Japan’s Mao Asada, the 2010 silver medalist, was also given consideration for the Olympic title.
In the short program, Kim showed she had little rust from the lay-off, skating ethereally, so much so that one Olympic writer tweeted, “Her skating would have made a lumberjack cry.” She led, but barely over Russia’s little known Adelina Sotnikova, with Italy’s Carolina Kostner, the 2012 World Champion but a veteran looking for her first Olympic medal, in third. Lipnitskaya struggled in the short and was only in fifth place, while Asada skated terribly for her, placing 16th, and ending her medal hopes.
Sotnikova had been runner-up at the 2013 and 2014 European Championships, and had been 2011 World Junior Champion, but had never skated at the World Championships or Olympics, and the gold medal seemed to be conceded to Kim. In the free skate she performed last and again skated beautifully, with no major flaws. But Sotnikova won the free skate and defeated Kim for the gold medal, by a fairly comfortable margin, presumably based on greater difficulty in her free skate, which included a triple Lutz-triple toe loop and a double axel-triple toe loop combination. Kostner took the bronze medal. Asada redeemed herself with a beautiful free skate that moved her up to sixth place overall.
After the competition there was some minor controversy about the judging, with fans and some experts claiming the result was flawed because of Russian bias. It appeared to die out quickly but then one month after the Olympics ended, the Korean Skating Federation protested the result to the International Skating Union (ISU), claiming prejudice on the judging panel, which had several judges from former Soviet republics.
Kim retired from Olympic-style competition after the Olympics ended. Lipnitskaya finished in fifth place, behind American Gracie Gold. For the first time since 1936 at the Olympics, no American man or woman won a medal in singles competition.

He had also won the double at the 2013 and 2015 World Championships and in 2011, the 5,000 metres at World, with a 10K silver. One week before this final, Farah had already defended his 10K gold medal, and he entered the 5,000 final a clear favorite.
As is common at major championships, the final was run at a relatively slow pace. With three laps remaining, four runners had separated themselves from the pack – Farah, Bahrain’s Albert Rop, Ethiopian Muktar Edris, and very surprisingly, American Richard Chelimo. The pace was not quick enough to maintain the gap, however, as Ugandan Joshua Kiprui Cheptegei joined the lead group with two laps left, with Canada’s Mo Ahmed and Americans Hassan Mead and Bernard Lagat close behind.
At the bell Ethiopian Hagos Gebrhiwet had moved onto Farah’s shoulder. At 300 metres left, Farah maintained his lead as Chelimo and Ahmed clipped heels, but Chelimo stayed on his feet and set chase for Farah, entering the stretch only a stride behind. That was as close as it would get, with Farah repeating his 5-10 double, matching the feat of Lasse Virén from 1972-76. Chelimo took a surprising silver medal, the first in this event for the United States since Bob Schul’s 1964 gold medal, and Gebrhiwet held on for the bronze. Shortly after the finish, Chelimo, Ahmed, and Edris were announced as disqualified for straying inside the rail. After an appeal, Chelimo and Ahmed, who finished fourth, were reinstated, while Edris remained DQed.

The Americans tried to adjust their rifles by adding set triggers and Carl Osburn and Willis Lee made this adjustment, but Bud Fisher, who won the individual free rifle, simply used his Springfield. Fisher almost did not start the event. He froze up at the beginning and did not fire a shot for 20 minutes. Finally, the American coach, Major W.

To date, no female Egyptian had ever won a gold medal at the Olympic games, but they had high hopes for Feryal Abdelaziz, who was ranked #2 in the world at the under 68 kg category. World ranked #1 in that category was Iryna Zaretska (AZE).
Zaretska won pool A, although she suffered a narrow defeat to runner-up Sofya Berultseva (KAZ) by a score of 5-4. Berultseva actually drew her first contest with Meltem Hocaoglu Akyol (TUR) and lost her final contest when already assured of progressing to the semi-finals. Pool B had a close outcome with Abdelaziz, Li Gong (CHN) and Elena Quirici (SUI) all winning two and drawing one contest each, so finishing level. Total number of points scored in all contests was the determining factor, which placed Quirici third in the group.
The first semi-final saw a comfortable win for Zaretska over Gong by a score of 7-2, although it was only in the final 15 seconds that Zaretska scored heavily (a yuko and ippon). The second semi-final was a much closer affair, Abdelaziz ultimately winning by 5-4 against Berultseva. All points were scored by yukos, with Abdelaziz taking an early lead and holding on to win.
The gold medal contest was a close match, with no scoring in the first two minutes. In the final minute of the contest, however, Abdelaziz scored two yukos without reply from Zaretska, to become the first female athlete from Egypt to win a gold medal.

A fall of star skater Kim Gi-Hun meant South Korea missed the final eight, while Great Britain (silver medallist at the 1992 World Championships) was also eliminated. 1993 World Champion became New Zealand, which set a new World Record in the process. But all of the other nations also stood a chance of winning a medal, excepting perhaps the home team, Norway.
In the end, it was Italy, the United States, Canada and Australia qualifying for the final. Italy was the fastest team in the heats, and the strongest squad in the final. Their top man was 500 m World Record holder Mirko Vuillermin, who was poised to make up for his narrow defeat in the 500 m. Departing about halfway, the Italians opened up a 1 to 2 second gap that they never gave up. Behind them, the Americans took the silver, with Eric Flaim among them. He had earlier won a silver medal as a long track speed skater (in 1988), and became the first person to win Olympic medals in both sports. The Australian team, in third, won their country’s first ever Olympic medal at the Winter Games.
In 1997, two members of the golden Italian team would be involved in motorcycle accidents. Within a month, first Orazio Fagone suffered the amputation of his right leg, and then Vuillermin was severely injured. Vuillermin recovered, but never returned to the sport, while Fagone is wheelchair-bound, but later picked up ice sledge hockey and competed in that sport in the 2006 Paralympics.

The competition was remarkably close, with Finland winning the gold medal over Switzerland by only 1.60 points – 1,358.30 to 1,356.70. Hungary was a distant third to win the bronze medal, while France was well back in fourth. Finland was led by the individual gold medalist, Veikko Huhtanen, with another team member, Heikki Savolainen, competing in his fourth Olympics, and he would return again in 1952, eventually winning nine Olympic medals. Another Finn, Einari Teräsvirta, had also competed in 1932 and 1936. The Swiss had four of the top six individual performers, but the consistency of the Finnish team brought them the gold medal. They were led by Walter Lehmann, silver medalist in the individual all-around. The final scoring member for Switzerland was Michael Reusch, who won two silver medals at Berlin in 1936, and three apparatus gold medals at the 1938 World Championships.

Thru 2001 he had been one of Armstrong’s lieutenants on the US Postal Service team but he left in 2002 to ride for Team CSC. He was renowned for his efforts in the 2003 Tour de France, in which he fractured his collarbone early in the race, but continued to ride despite the pain, winning the 16th stage in a long solo breakaway and placing fourth in GC in Paris. In 2004 he moved to Phonak but this time had to leave the Tour de France after a back injury sustained in a 13th stage fall, and then had to deal with the death of his beloved golden retriever, Tugboat (aka Tugger). On the Vouliagmeni course, Hamilton started out slowly as his earpiece radio was broken and he could not hear the splits. But he finished the race stronger than any rider and bested the time of defending gold medalist Vyacheslav Yekimov by almost 19 seconds, winning the gold medal.
And then the excrement struck the cooling apparatus. Hamilton’s doping test showed evidence of blood doping. But it was not conclusive, and no action was taken initially, so the B sample was frozen. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) asked for a review of the tests, but with the B sample having been frozen, it was inadequate to test for blood transfusions. Because a doping positive required both the A and B samples to be positive, Hamilton was exonerated and retained his gold medal.
A few weeks later, racing in the Vuelta a España, Hamilton again tested positive for blood transfusions, and this time both the A and B samples were positive. He lost his contract with Phonak, and was banned from cycling for two years, despite appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which were rejected. When Hamilton’s ban was about to run out in late 2006, he was then implicated in the Spanish doping scandal, Operación Puerto, when faxes which seemed to be from Hamilton’s wife, Haven, showed evidence of payments for various performance enhancing drugs. Hamilton finally was able to return to competition in approved races in 2008 and immediately won the U.S. National Championship. But the entire episode took a huge toll on him financially and he and his wife divorced after the strain affected their marriage.
In 2009 Hamilton again failed a doping test and was banned for eight years and he retired from competition, of necessity. In May 2011 he admitted to doping during his career. In August 2012 the IOC disqualified Hamilton from the 2004 Olympics after he had written a letter to IOC President Rogge admitting his doping violations. Later in 2012 he published a book The Secret Race in which he detailed his doping history and implicated many professional riders for widespread doping in the professional peleton.

One interesting skater not present was Luo Zhihuan, a Chinese skater who had won the distance at the 1963 World Championships. But China was not an IOC member nation, and would not compete at the Winter Olympics until 1980.

The competition was extremely close with the top nine finishers all going thru 700 metres in 1:00 or 1:01, and thru 1,100 metres in 1:34 to 1:36. Thus the final lap decided the placements. The early leader was Soviet skater Eduard Matusevich, who finished in 2:12.2 in the fifth pair. Järvinen was in the next pair but barely missed that time with 2:12.4. Antson went off in the eighth pair and finished in 2:10.3, a time that would bring him the gold medal. Dutchman Kees Verkerk started late, in the 21st pair, and matched Antson’s splits thru 1,100 metres, but finished slightly slower, in 2:10.6, and earned the silver medal.

Polyansky was the 1986 World Champion in both backstroke events, but Berkoff had pioneered a new technique. He swam as far as he could underwater after the push-off, often not emerging on top of the water until the 35-40 metre mark. This usually gave him a big lead at the turn, and it was so advantageous that the other swimmers had to adopt the technique, although Berkoff usually still led through the first 40. Berkoff used it in Seoul to break the world record in the preliminaries, recording 54.51.
But in the Seoul final, Berkoff used the technique but only led Japan’s Daichi Suzuki by about a body length at the turn. That was less than expected and it was not enough, as Suzuki came home faster to win the gold medal. Berkoff won silver, barely holding off Polyansky. In fifth place was Canada’s Mark Tewksbury, the 1991 Pan Pacific Champion, who never adapted well to the new underwater technique. He would not need it long. As soon as the Seoul Olympics ended, Berkoff’s underwater start was banned, with the new rule requiring that backstrokers surface and begin stroking on top of the water by 10 metres. This was later changed to 15 metres.

West Germany’s Ernst Mueller, the European champion, and the new teenage sensation from the USA, Donald Curry, were both victims of the boycott. Jamaican Mike McCallum was present in the Russian capital but was stricken by appendicitis shortly before the Opening Ceremony and was forced to withdraw. It was expected that this class would follow many others at the 1980 Olympic Games and develop into a clash between Eastern Europe and Cuba. The fighter that conspired to upset the applecart was a 20-year-old from Uganda whose main claim to fame was a silver medal at the World Junior Championships. John Mugabi blazed a path of destruction in the early rounds and knocked out his first three opponents to reach the semi-final. On the other side of the draw Andres Aldama of Cuba was emulating Mugabi with the exception of a hard fought points win over Israyel Hakobkokhyan of the USSR. The two men then had contrasting semi-final wins. Aldama comfortably outpointed his East German opponent but Mugabi only advanced on a 3-2 decision over Kazimierz Szczerba of Poland although it must be pointed that the two dissenting voters were both from Warsaw Pact countries. The two big hitters faced off in the final where the greater experience of the Cuban, who was in his second Olympic final, negated the raw power of the Ugandan. For Aldama this was the pinnacle of his career and he never achieved the same sort of success gain. Mugabi went on to be a popular and charismatic addition to the professional scene.

In both rounds of competition, however, the West Germans had to contend with a strong Australian delegation that consisted of Paul Reedy, Gary Gullock, Tim McLaren, and Tony Lovrich. The Australians won their heat in a time less than a second slower than the West Germans won theirs and, in the final, engaged their European opponents in a fantastic drive to the gold medal, which they lost by only 0.43 seconds.

He commenced his ride to the gold with second place in the dressage, which was conducted in a near-empty Stade de Colombes.
The most important part of the competition was the cross-country, which accounted for 70% of the points. The endurance course consisted of the following sections: 7 km road and tracks in the Bois de Boulogne at 240 m/min; 4 km steeplechase on the racetrack of Auteuil at 550 m/min; 15 km roads and tracks in the Bois de Boulogne at 240 m/min; 8 km cross-country in the Bois de Meudon at 450 m/min, with 36 obstacles up to 1.15m high, 3.50m wide; and 2 km free gallop in Villacoublay at 333 m/min. It turned out to be somewhat of a chaos. Van der Voort van Zijp fell back to 27th position, but the Dutch team protested after it appeared his times had been inadvertently swapped with another rider. The corrected results put him in second place, and first overall. The accuracy of the timing equipment was also generally doubted, with only two of 45 participants finishing within the time limit. The Swedish rider Lewenhaupt stumbled over an oxer, and his horse Cauter had to be put down.
Van der Voort van Zijp’s first place was not endangered in the jumping competition, as he cleared all obstacles for maximum points. His gold medal was the first equestrian medal at the Olympic Games for the Netherlands. Van der Voort van Zijp was later climbed to the rank of Cavalry Inspector. He fought at the Grebbeberg stronghold during the German invasion in 1940, and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of war.

Instead, their nations were represented by Rolf Peterson and Aurel Vernescu respectively, the latter of whom was the current European and World runner-up.

The only other major medalist in the tournament was the Soviet Union’s Igor Pisarev, who had been second in the event in 1956. Hungary, the defending Olympic runner-up, sent Mihály Hesz.
In the opening round, the first heat was the most competitive and saw Hansen win it in the fastest time, ahead of Hesz and Peterson. Vernescu bested Suhrbier in the second heat, while Pisarev finished third behind Poland’s Władysław Szuszkiewicz and Great Britain’s Alistair Wilson in a heat where everyone advanced. Szuszkiewicz, in a heat that included Hesz and was won by Günther Pfaff of Austria, was the only one of these men not to advance after the semi-finals. Vernescu and Hansen won the other heats, the latter once again with the round’s fastest time. Considering his performance thus far, Hansen seemed as if he was a shoo-in for gold, but he struggled heavily in the final and finished seventh.

In 1951, he had also broken the world record and lowered it to 8.07,3. In January 1952, that time had been bested by Nikolay Mamonov, who had used 8.03,7 at the Kazakh Championships held at Medeo. But that time would not be officially recognized as a world record until 1955, and Mamonov did not compete in Oslo either.
With a light freeze, the ice conditions in Bislett were excellent. Andersen, departing in the third pair against Wim van der Voort, started eagerly. In a clean race with slightly increasing lap times, Andersen set a time of 8.10,6 just seconds away from his own world record, but beating both the track and Olympic record. The gold medal seemed secured already for Andersen.
At the recent European Championships, Andersen had won the 5,000 m by some 13 seconds over Kees Broekman and Kornél Pajor. Pajor was not allowed to compete in Oslo, but Broekman was. Starting two pairs after Andersen, it was immediately clear that he would not threaten the leader. A steady race left Broekman exactly 11 seconds behind first place. Several other medal candidates were still to come after Broekman. At the pre-Olympic Hamar competition, Pentti Lammio had finished second behind Broekman, while Sverre Haugli was disqualified there; he had finished second behind Andersen at the Norwegian Championships. Haugli skated first, and was faster than the Dutch skater for much of the race. Their split times in the last part of the race were close, and Haugli only lost the silver medal in the last lap, finishing 8 tenths behind Broekman. Lammio then had a similarly fast start, but blew up in the remaining laps. Of the remaining skaters, Anton Huiskes (Netherlands) was the only one to beat 8.30, but he finished well clear of the medals. The silver medal won by his team mate Broekman was the first Dutch speed skating medal won at the Olympics.

The first round of the final was a tepid affair with the Hungarian cautiously edging into a small lead but the second round was very different and proved to be a tour de force for Kovács  as he picked off the onrushing Mesa seemingly at will and cruised into a seven point lead that could not be pegged back. He became the first Hungarian to win an Olympic boxing gold since the Munich Games of 1972.
Kovács resisted the temptation to turn professional straight away in order  to contest the 1997 World Championships which were to be held in Budapest. After duly winning that title he stepped into the professional ranks and went on a run of 19 successive victories which included a victory in a fight for the European title. In his 20th fight he won the vacant WBO world title but his reign as Hungary’s first professional world title holder was brief as he lost the title on his first defence to fellow Atlanta medallist Pablo Chacón.

She was world ranked #1 in 2005-2007, and  was a heavy favorite in 2007 to win the World Championships, but did not even make the US team at the Trials, that title going to Britain’s Christine Ohuruogu. It turned out that she had been ill, diagnosed with Behçet’s Syndrome, a variant of an inflammatory arthritis. After receiving treatment she was healthier in 2008 and looked good early in the year, winning the US Olympic Trials easily. In the final in Beijing she started out as expected, going thru 300 metres in 35.8 with a big lead. But that was it. She tied up on the final straight, possibly with a tight hamstring, and was passed by both Ohuruogu and Jamaica’s Shericka Williams. Ohuruogu barely held off Williams for the gold medal and Richards had to hang on to get bronze.
Ohuruogu was a somewhat controversial choice for the British team. She had served a one-year ban from the IAAF for missing three doping tests but the British Olympic Association by-laws mandate a life ban from the Olympic Games for any doping offense. The same by-laws allow an appeal to be made against this ban and the appeal panel decided in her favour in November 2007.

She was fired soon and picked up the sport again 7 months before the Games. Meanwhile, her rivals had continued normally. China’s Zhang Yanmei improved the World Record during the 1993 World Championships in Beijing, although the distance was eventually won by the overall World Champion, Nathalie Lambert.
Turner already had a reputation for being an aggressive skater - “competitive” in her own words - and she displayed this again at the Lillehammer Games. In the quarter-finals, Turner bumped several times into Lambert, sending her into the boards and out of contention. While Lambert named Turner “the dirtiest woman on skates”, the American continued unabashedly. She survived a fall in the semis (for which Isabelle Charest was disqualified), and made it into the final. Zhang led the decider with two laps to go, when Turner made a move to pass her. In doing so, she clearly touched the Chinese woman, who claimed Turner had grabbed her. But the referees had not seen anything, and the result was allowed to stand, much to the chagrin of Zhang. Already angered by their disqualification during the relay, she stomped away from the victory ceremony as soon as the U.S. national anthem had finished, throwing away her flowers in anger.
The IOC was not pleased with Zhang’s display, for which the Chinese later apologized. However, most of the other skaters seemed to agree with Zhang, as a Belgian proposal to allow referees to see television replays at the upcoming World Championships was quickly signed by all team leaders, except for the Americans. Some opponents took it even further, sending Turner hate mail through the Olympic Village messaging system.

Although it started at 0900, the day was hot, with temperatures reaching 34° C. (93° F.). Italy dominated the race, winning by over two minutes from Germany, which had all East German riders. Italy was led by the eventual runner-up in the individual road race, Livio Trapè, while the GDR team was led by Gustav-Adolf Schur, who had been world amateur road champion in 1958-59. The Soviet Union won the bronze medal, led by Viktor Kapitonov, who would outsprint Trapè to win the road race gold medal.
Unfortunately, the story of the race was the death of the first Olympian in competition since the 1912 Olympics, when Portugal’s Francisco Lázaro died during the marathon. The Danish team was in mid-race when one of the riders, Knut Enemark Jensen, began to ride erratically. He had difficulty keeping on the wheel of his teammates and finally, after several minutes of this problem, collapsed off his bike. He was taken to hospital and died a few hours later. The official verdict was initially given as a victim of sunstroke (heat stroke), although other reports mention that he had sustained a fractured skull during his fall. Media reports noted that the Danish team doctors admitted giving Jensen Roniacol, a vasodilator, and initial reports attributed his death to drugs. However, the post-mortem examination was never directly released and drugs as a cause of his death has never been proven, but in Davis Maraniss’s book Rome 1960: The Olympics that Changed the World, he noted, “Decades later a Danish journalist tracked down Doctor Alberto Marpiori, one of  the Italians who had performed Jensen’s autopsy. The doctor said that he remembered the case well as it was the first time his institute had found evidence of doping. He said several substances, including amphetamines, were found in Jensen’s system.” Jensen’s death, along with the later death of Tom Simpson in the 1967 Tour de France, were two of the high-publicity factors that pushed the International Olympic Committee to institute drug testing at the 1968 Olympics.

She was the world record holder with 4:03.85 set winning the 1988 Olympics. German Dagmar Hase was a backstroker who elected to swim the 400 free at the German Trials as a training race and because it would not interfere with her backstroke events. In Barcelona Evans qualified first and Hase second, and Hase said, “I figured the gold would be taken by Evans, but I thought I could get silver or bronze.” Or maybe even better.
In the final, Evans set a fast pace, hoping to bury the other swimmers, but she never fully dropped Hase, who was only a body length behind at 300 metres. Hase then started gaining on the final two laps and caught Evans 10 metres from the wall, outtouching her in 4:07.18, Evans won silver in 4:07.37, only the ninth fastest time of her career, although she had been slowing each year in this race since 1989.
In her specialty, the backstroke, Hase did not do as well in Barcelona, winning silver in the 200 back and missing the A final in the 100. By Atlanta in 1996, she was a freestyler, winning bronze in the 200 free, and silvers in the 400 and 800 freestyles.

The undoubted favourite was Hungary’s László Papp who was attempting to become the first three-time Olympic boxing champion, having already won at middleweight in 1948 and light-middleweight in 1952. Standing between Papp and his goal were the European champion Zbigniew Pietrzykowski of Poland and the brilliant young Puerto Rican-American soldier José Torres. Papp used his experience to befuddle his much younger opponents and outpointed Pietrzykowski in the semi-finals then comfortably defeating Torres in the final to claim his piece of history.
Uniquely for a fighter from a communist country Papp was allowed to turn professional on his return home from Australia. After an eight year pro career in which he remained unbeaten, he was on the verge of a shot at the world title when the Hungarian authorities decided that boxing for pay was “incompatible with socialist principles” and forced his retirement. José Torres went on to win the world professional light-heavyweight title in 1965 and in retirement became one of the professional sport’s leading officials. The two bronze medalists also made their mark on the sport. Pietrzykowski won medals at the next two Olympics whilst John McCormack became European middleweight champion as a pro.

In the first round, the Pole Stefan Hula held a surprising lead, after a jump of 111 m. He was followed by his compatriot Stoch and the Norwegian Johann André Forfang, who were equal in second place. Wellinger was still in contention, lying in fifth place, with the German Richard Freitag fourth.
In the second round, Robert Johansson of Norway, lying 10th after the first round, equaled the hill record with a jump of 113.5 m.  With five jumpers to go, Johansson was still leading, but was overtaken by Wellinger, who put in a stylish jump, also 113.5 m.

In 1910, Hillman began a coaching career at Dartmouth which lasted until his death in 1945.  With fellow 1904 Olympian Lawson Robertson, Hillman is still listed as the co-holder of the fastest time for the three-legged 100 yard race - 11.0 seconds.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"There was only one favorite in the women’s middleweight freestyle wrestling event at the 2012 Summer Olympics: Kaori Icho of Japan. Aside from a forfeit at the 2007 Asian Championships, the Japanese wrestler had won her last 149 matches, held the only two Olympic crowns in the event (2004 and 2008), and was a seven-time World Champion, having won the event in every tournament since 2002, with the exception of the oddly-held 2008 edition and 2009, when she had taken a break from wrestling. No other competitor came close to matching her dominance. She breezed through the tournament to meet Jing Ruixue of China in the final, who had been World Champion in the non-Olympic 67 kg division in 2006 and 2007, runner-up in the middleweight in 2005, and a bronze medalist at the most recent edition. The battle for the crown was almost no contest: Icho had the first round won by the first thirty seconds, having already scored three points on Jing. In the second period, Icho reversed a near-takedown by the leg to score one point and scored another in the final twenty seconds, giving Japan both wrestling medals of the day, following Hitomi Obara’s earlier victory in the flyweight division.
The bronze medal matches were somewhat less one-sided. Canadian Martine Dugrenier, thrice World Champion (2008, 2009, and 2010) and thrice runner-up (2005, 2006, 2007) in the 67 kg category, fought in her second Olympics as a middleweight competitor, but had the misfortune of drawing against Icho in the first round. In the battle for the bronze medal she put up a good fight against Soronzonboldyn Battsetseg of Mongolia, the 2010 World Champion in the 59 kg class (also non-Olympic), but was unable to match her opponent’s skill or score any points, losing 0-2 and 0-1 and giving Mongolia its first Olympic medal in wrestling since 1980. The battle for the final podium spot was perhaps the most hard fought, pitting Monika Michalik of Poland, twice bronze-medalist at the World Championships (2006 and 2007) and thrice gold medalist at the European Championships (2003 in the 59 kg division, 2005, 2009), against Lyubov Volosova of Russia, three-time World Championship runner-up (2001 in the 56 kg class, 2008, 2009) and once bronze medalist (2010) and twice European Champion (2006 at 56 kg, 2010). The first round went to par terre, where Michalik drew the advantaged position and scored on her opponent. Volosova had her revenge, however, outscoring the Polish wrestler in the second period 3-1 and converting the advantage in a third-round par terre to win the bronze.

(118.2 miles) mass start race.,na,"With the Soviet-led boycott, the top riders from the Soviet Union, the GDR, and Poland were not present in Los Angeles. By now, American riders were becoming more prominent internationally and the home course advantage and absent Eastern European riders led many to pick American riders as favorites. Davis Phinney was highly considered, as the best sprinter on the US team, but the course was a hilly one of 12 laps over 190.2 km., and Phinney, not a great climber, missed the winning break, eventually finishing fifth. American Alexi Grewal and Canadian Steve Bauer broke away on the penultimate lap.  Though they never had a large lead on the trailing Norwegian twosome of Dag Otto Lauritzen and Morten Saether, Grewal and Bauer were able to stay away to the finish. Bauer was considered the better sprinter but Grewal pipped him in the sprint by less than a wheel. Bauer later had a solid professional career, finishing fourth at the 1988 Tour de France, and wearing the yellow jersey in both 1988 and 1990. One rider who did not finish was Miguel Induráin, who from 1991-95 became the first cyclist to win the Tour de France in five consecutive years.
Grewal also turned professional but his career was less impressive. He won a few domestic races but never won in Europe in a major international race. Grewal’s mere participation in 1984 was controversial. He had tested positive only 10 days before the Olympics, after the Coors Classic in Colorado, for phenylethylamine, a stimulant. He was suspended for 30 days by the US Cycling Federation and dropped from the Olympic team. But Grewal appealed the suspension, noting that he took albuterol for asthma and the tests were not sophisticated enough to tell the difference between the two drugs.  Reinstated, he was able to race at Los Angeles.

Yego took the lead in round one with 88.24, which would remain his best mark and would eventually bring him the silver medal. It was also his only fair throw, as he passed on three other throws, including his final two, the victim of a chronic ankle injury. He would be taken off the field in a wheelchair.
In round two Walcott threw 85.38, his best effort, which was good for bronze.

The Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Regatta had been won in 1910 and 1911 by a Magdalen College (Oxford) crew.  In 1909 that title had been won by the Belgian crew from the Royal Club Nautique de Gand.  Unfortunately the Gand crew was not at Stockholm, nor was Magdalen College.  The British were represented by New College (Oxford), and the Leander Club, although most of the Leander rowers were from Magdalen College (Oxford).  Canada did send a Toronto Argonauts eight, which had won the 1911 championships at the National Association of Amateur Oarsmen.
In a bad draw, Leander and the Argonauts were drawn against each other in round one, with Leander narrowly defeating the Toronto crew.  Leander also survived close races against Australasia in the quarters (by less than a boat length) and Germany in the semis.  On the other hand, the New College crew had a relatively easy time of it, winning the first two rounds handily against Norway and Sweden, and receiving a bye in the semi-finals.
The final was closely fought.  The two boats were even for 1,000 metres, when Leander pulled ahead before the series of turns.  They were never caught, eventually winning by about one length.  Leander was awarded possession of the Challenge Trophy for the coxed eights event, which had been donated in 1908 by the Italian Count and IOC Member, Eugenio Brunetta d’Usseaux.
The final was noteworthy for a controversy that developed in the choice of lanes, which has engendered a tradition at New College Boat Club to this day. The finalists’ captains were to toss to choose lanes, which was won by New College. Tradition had it that they were to offer the choice of lanes to Leander, who, by tradition, were supposed to refuse the offer, allowing New College to have their choice. However, the Leander/Magdalen captain accepted the offer, choosing the better lane.
At the medal ceremony, Sweden’s King Gustav V expressed his dismay over the ungentlemanly conduct by Leander/Magdalen, and presented his colors to New College. Since that time, New College Boat Club has raced in purple and gold, the colors of Sweden’s Royal House. New College has also adopted the tradition of toasting to “God damn bloody Magdalen,” which the 1912 New College stroke, Robert Bourne, supposedly said as the crossed the line in Stockholm in second pace. On the letterhead of the New College Boat Club, into the 21st century, can be found the abbreviaton “GDBM”.

61005,"100 metres, Men",1972 Summer Olympics,18,Athletics,/editions/18/sports/ATH,31 August –  1 September 1972,"Olympiastadion, Olympiapark, München",85 from 55 countries,na,na,"For the first time ever, there was a favorite who was not an American. Soviet Valery Borzov had shown promise when he won the 1968 European Junior double over 100/200. The next year he won the European 100, and in 1971 he won the sprint double at the European Championships. Borzov also posted a succession of top times and defeated several American sprinters in international dual meets. The top American coming since Mexico City was the 1968 200 metre silver medalist, John Carlos, but turned to pro football, and was ineligible due to amateur rules. He tried out for the Philadelphia Eagles and then played in Canada with the Montreal Alouettes. The US Olympic Trials put forward three good sprinters in Eddie Hart, Rey Robinson, and Robert Taylor. In the final of that event Hart and Robinson equaled the world record of 9.9.
In München all the favorites got thru the first round. The quarter-finals were later that day and the Americans went back to the Olympic Village to rest up. While there, they noticed something unusual while watching some of the events on television. It appeared that the 100 metre quarter-finals were beginning at the stadium – and they were not there! They rushed to the stadium, hoping to make it in time for their heats, but both Hart and Robinson were too late. Taylor was in the third heat and barely made it in time, qualifying for the semi-finals, just behind Borzov. The US Olympic Committee appealed the disqualification of Hart and Robinson, but to no avail – they were out. It turned out that US track coach Stan Wright was going by an outdated schedule that showed the quarter-finals starting at 6 PM (1800), instead of their actual 4 PM (1600) start time. With the two main Americans out, the road was clear for Borzov, although it is likely he would have won the gold medal even if they had run. He won fairly easily in the final with Taylor second, followed by 1968 silver medalist Lennox Miller. Three days later, Borzov ran in the 200 metre final, which was actually his best distance, and completed the sprint double, the first non-American to do that since Percy Williams (CAN) in 1928.

Yu was one of the defending Olympic champions and a two-time reigning World Champion; in 2008 and 2010 her partner had been Du Jing but, for the 2011 World Championships, she had joined with Wang, a runner-up from the 2010 edition. China also had the number two seed of Tian Qing and Zhao Yunlei, who had been the runners-up in 2011. South Korea’s Ha Jeong-Eun and Kim Min-Jeong and Japan’s Mizuki Fujii and Reika Kakiiwa, who ranked third and fourth in the world respectively, were also top prospects to challenge for the podium.
In perhaps the most publicized controversy of the 2012 Games, Wang and Yu were booed off the court after what appeared to be an intentional loss to Jeong Gyeong-Eun and Kim Ha-Na of South Korea during the group stage. Losing the match ensured that Wang and Yu would avoid meeting their compatriots Tian and Zhao until the final and guaranteed China the top two podium spots should each team win their quarter and semi-finals. In the ranking-deciding match of another pool, both Ha and Kim and their Indonesian opponents Greysia Polii and Meiliana Jauhari also seemed to be intentionally losing points in an effort to fix the match. Following a review by the Badminton World Federation, all eight players were disqualified from the Games for “not using one’s best efforts to win a match” and “conducting oneself in a manner that is clearly abusive or detrimental to the sport” and were replaced in the final brackets by the third and fourth-place finishers of their pools. Some felt that this decision was overly harsh, considering that the competitors’ strategy had been a long-term one, seeking to place themselves in the best position to win the tournament at the cost of a single match. Others argued that the players were punished for a faulty rule system that incentivized such behavior and questioned the decision to allow teams that had not yet won a single match to compete for a medal. Most, however, agreed that, above all, the match-fixing went against the competitive spirit of sport and had sullied badminton’s reputation on the international scene. With further punishment left to the national governing bodies of the sport, the South Koreans were banned from all national and international competition for two years (later reduced to six months) while their coaches received a lifetime ban (later reduced to two years). Polii and Jauhari received four month bans while Yu Yang retired mere hours after being disqualified.
With two of the best teams out of contention, Tian and Zhao and Fuijii and Kakiiwa easily survived to the finals, where the Chinese squad emerged victorious 21-10, 25-23. The bronze medal match was fought between the Russian duo of Valeriya Sorokina and Nina Vislova and the Canadians Alex Bruce and Michele Li, who had been the third and fourth-place finishers respectively in the pool originally won by Jeong and Kim. Having lost to the Russians in the group stage 8-21, 10-21, Bruce and Li made a surprising comeback by defeating the Australian duo of Leanne Choo and Renuga Veeran 21-9, 18-21, 21-18 and putting up a valiant effort against the Japanese team in a 12-21, 21-19, 13-21 loss. They were only able to improve their performance against the Russians marginally in the bronze medal match, however, losing 9-21, 10-21.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"As the defending Olympic Champion, the reigning World Champion (with additional titles in 2006 and the light-heavyweight division in 2005), and the most recent Asian Games Champion, Ilya Ilyin was heavily favored to take gold again in the men’s middle-heavyweight division of the 2012 Olympic weightlifting tournament. Among his strongest challengers were Aleksandr Ivanov of Russia, the 2010 World Champion, his compatriot Andrey Demanov, the 2011 European Champion, 2008 runner-up, and 2006 and 2009 bronze medalist, Anatolii Cîrîcu of Moldova, the reigning European Champion and runner-up in 2011, and Kim Min-Jae of South Korea, twice Asian Champion (2011 and 2012) and bronze medalist at the 2009 World and 2010 Asian Championships.
The competition in the snatch portion was tight, with Ilyin, Ivanov, and Kim all lifting 185 kg. Kim fell down to seventh after failing to lift 220 kg, and then 221 kg, before Ilyin even made a first attempt. Ilyin came in at 224 kg and lifted it with ease, breaking his own Olympic record for total points with a score of 409. Though six tried, only half were able to match this, starting with Ivanov who lifted the same weight and thus tied Ilyin in points and, having the lower body weight, put himself in the gold medal position. Demanov then managed 225 kg in two attempts, lining himself up for bronze, but he was quickly displaced by Cîrîcu, who lifted 226 kg to tie the score and, as the lighter competitor, knock Demanov off the podium. For his second attempt, Ilyin lifted 228 kg, again breaking his own Olympic record (this time in the clean and jerk) and setting a world record for total points with 413. Neither Cîrîcu nor Ivanov could respond and thus, assured of gold, Ilyin went for a world record clean and jerk lift, succeeding in his attempt and setting the new bar at 233 kg.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
And in November 2016 this event’s results underwent drastic changes, as it proved to be possibly the “dirtiest” event in Olympic history, maybe rivaled only by the 2012 women’s athletics 1,500 metres. Between 21 November 2016 and 12 January 2017 seven of the top 11 finishers in this event were implicated in PED usage and disqualified. This included all three medalists – Ilya Ilyin, Aleksandr Ivanov, and Anatolii Cîrîcu, but also the 4th Andrey Demanov, 6th (İntiqam Zairov), 7th (Almas Uteshov), and 11th (Norayr Vardanyan) place finishers. The athlete listed 7th, as of October 2019, is Abbas Al-Qaisoum (KSA), who originally finished only 15th.
Iranian Saeid Mohammadpour was moved up to the gold medal and Korean Kim Min-Jae was awarded the silver medal. Such was the carnage in the results of this event, however, that the original ninth-place finisher, Poland’s Tomasz Zielinski, who seemed eligible for the bronze medal, was not originally advanced to a medal, likely because he had a positive pre-Games test for nandrolone just before the 2016 Rio Olympics. His brother, Adrian Zielinski, also tested positive before the 2016 Games and was sent home. Ilyin set a record of sorts, by defending his gold medal disqualification from the 2008 Olympics in the same weight class, which was also announced in November 2016. He became the first Olympian to ever “defend” a gold medal disqualification.

Abdvali and Guénot met during the quarterfinals, where the Frenchman defeated the Iranian in a controversial match that saw Abdvali lose the first round to penalty fouls after a successful par terre defense and the second after a successful par terre offense that was discounted after it was deemed too low on the body. While the replay showed that Abdvali was indeed too low in the second round, many Iranians felt that the referee and the match judge were unfairly penalizing Abdvali while ignoring fouls committed by Guénot.
Abdvali was denied any chance at a medal when Guénot lost to Kim Hyeon-Wu, a bronze medalist from the 2011 World Championships, in the semi-finals.

For the final podium spot Guénot faced Pedro Mulens of Cuba, a two-time World Championship bronze medalist (2009 and 2011). The Frenchman immediately asserted his dominance with a four-point takedown to win the first round and then maintained a more defensive attitude in the second to bring the period to par terre.

But there were two Irish governing bodies in athletics, and he aligned himself with the “wrong” one, the National Athletic and Cycling Association of Ireland (NACAI), or at least the one that was not recognized by the IAAF. The problem was that the NACAI claimed control over all 32 Irish counties, including Ulster, and the IAAF demanded that they be in charge of only the 26 counties of the Irish Free State. Thus O’Callaghan was not allowed to compete. He would have been favored again, throwing 59.56 (195-5) in 1937, well above the world record although it was not recognized. In his absence the first two places were taken by Germans, with Karl Hein winning a big upset victory. He trailed his countryman, Erwin Blask, until the final throw but came thru in the last round with 56.49 (185-4) to secure the gold medal. In 1938 Blask would throw 59.00 (193-7) to break the long-standing world record of 57.77 (189-6½) set by Paddy Ryan in 1913.

Tournament held outdoors with 11 men to a side.,na,"Originally, ten nations intended to send teams to Berlin, but Denmark, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden eventually withdrew their entries. The absence of the Scandinavian countries, where the indoor variety was more popular, was particularly disappointing. This essentially left the title to the other native country of the sport, Germany. Also competing in Berlin were four Central European nations – Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, and Romania – and the United States, the only non-European entry, with the Romanian team made up of ethnic Germans from Transylvania. After setting aside Hungary (22-0) and the United States (29-1), Germany encountered somewhat more resistance in the final pool. The last match against Austria, played in a packed Olympic Stadium was relatively closely contested, but the Germans still emerged victorious: 10-6.
In 1938, Germany and Austria also finished 1-2 at the inaugural world championships (indoor handball). Later that year, the first outdoor handball world championship was also won by the Germans. Austria was absent, as it had been annexed by Germany earlier in the year. Apart from eight German Olympic champions, the world champion team also featured Austrian Leopold Wohlrab, who had won a silver medal in Berlin.

At their Davos training races, Julius Skutnabb (8:50.4) and Clas Thunberg (8:51.9) had recorded the fastest times of the season. Three of the four Norwegians in competition also had sub-9 minute performances listed, all skated at a Frogner meet shortly before the Olympics, World Record holder Harald Strøm being the fastest with 8:52.3.
The second competition of the day got underway with the first two pairs being rescheduled due to non-starters. Charlie Gorman and Léon Quaglia were the first to hit the ice. Quaglia had won the French Championships at the same rink two weeks earlier, and he improved on his performance in the 5000 m by more than 15 seconds: 9.08.6. The first to go under 9 minutes was Frithjof Paulsen of Norway, followed by his compatriot Harald Strøm who listed 8:54.6. Strøm’s time was good, considering that he had caught the flu on the previous day. As the Norwegian flag bearer, he had been out in the rain for hours wearing nothing but his race outfit.
The strongest North American distance skater, Val Bialas was coupled with Julius Skutnabb, and delivered an interesting fight, won by the 34-year-old Finn who also improved the season’s best time to 8:48.4. His teammate Thunberg did not have such a strong competitor in his race, but that did not stop him from outclassing the rest of the field with 8:39.0. The two remaining Norwegians, Larsen and Sigurd Moen, both delivered fine performances, but were also unable to approach the leading Finnish duo.
Thunberg was one of the dominant speed skaters of the era. He only started skating at age 20, but managed to win 5 World Championships and 4 European titles. One of his nicknames was “The Nurmi of the ice”, which he considered somewhat insulting, as he thought Paavo Nurmi might as well be called the “Thunberg of the track”.

Japan’s Mitsuo Tsukahara had won this event at the 1972 Olympics, and in Montréal he had the highest score in qualifying and the final round to defend his gold medal, matching the feat of his countryman, Takashi Ono, who won this event in 1956-60.

Wise had been somewhat uneven since Sochi, but had recently won the superpipe at the 2018 Winter X Games and was seen as being at the top of his game going into the PyeongChang Olympics. The silver and bronze medalists from 2014, Mike Riddle of Canada and Kévin Rolland of France respectively, were also present in Sochi, and had repeated their podium finishes at the most recent edition of the World Championships, where American Aaron Blunck had taken gold.
The United States, led by Blunck, took the top three spots in the qualifying round, but Wise was not among them, finishing far down in the pack at eighth, behind Riddle and Roland. In second was Alex Ferreira, runner-up at both the 2016 and 2018 Winter X Games superpipe, while Torin Yater-Wallace, the most recent Winter X bronze medalist, was a bit behind in third. Nonetheless, all of the favorites advanced to the final and there were few surprises overall.
The same could not be said, however, about the final itself. Rolland had it the worst, and failed to complete any of his runs, suffering a terrible-looking crash in his final attempt. Yater-Wallace had an unimpressive first run, and was unable to complete the final two, also landing hard on his third. Ferreira, on the other hand, had an excellent final round, not only being one of just two competitors to complete all three runs successfully, but also scoring over 90 points in each and improving on his total each time. With a final score of 96.40, it looked as if Ferreira had clinched the title, but an outstanding third run from Wise, who had crashed on his previous two attempts, saw him surpass his compatriot with an outstanding performance and land in the gold medal position. Thus Ferreira had to settle for silver, while 16 year-old Nico Porteous of New Zealand took bronze on the strength of his impressive second run.

But the ninth starter was another Italian, unheralded Daniela Ceccarelli, and she bested her teammate with 1:13.59. After the 15 seeds finished, the next starter was Croatian Janica Kostelić, who had already won the combined in Salt Lake.

Ho’s teammate Han Gyong-Si and Hungarian Béla Oläh had both weighed the same at 52.0 kg (0.1 kg more than Ho) prior to the competition so they were re-weighed after the event ended, and Han was awarded the bronze medal as by then he weighed 0.1 kg less than Oläh.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"Since his first appearance at the Olympic Games in 2000, Artur Taymazov of Uzbekistan had reached the finals of the men’s super-heavyweight freestyle wrestling tournament every time and had lost only once, in his first attempt. He was also a two time World Champion (2003 and 2006) and runner-up (2001 and 2010), twice Asian Champion (2000 and 2011), and three-time Asian Games gold medalist (2002, 2006, and 2010). Nonetheless he was expected to have some significant challengers at the 2012 Summer Olympics, most notably Bilyal Makhov of Russia, a three-time (2007, 2009, 2010) World Champion and 2010 European Champion. Makhov lost his world title in 2011 to Aleksey Shemarov of Belarus, however, who would also be looking to challenge Taymazov in the final. Not to be counted out was Taha Akgül of Turkey, the reigning European Champion.
Taymazov was drawn into a relatively easy half that included Shemarov, who was defeated by Tervel Dlagnev of the United States, the 2011 Pan American Champion. Taymazov pinned Dlagnev in the semi-finals and went on to meet Davit Modzmanashvili of Georgia in the gold medal match. Modzmanashvili was a bronze medalist at the most recent World and European Championships who had returned from a doping violation in 2008 and defeated Bilyal Makhov in the semi-finals of the London tournament. In the final, Taymazov proved himself once again to be worthy of Olympic Gold, winning the first round par terre by successfully reversing Modzmanashvili’s advantage and pushing the Georgian out of the ring in the second period for an unanswered point that earned him the Olympic crown.
The first bronze medal match pitted Dlagnev against Komeil Ghasemi of Iran, runner up to Taymazov at the most recent Asian Championships. Ghasemi wasted no time in the first period, winning it within the first 20 seconds by scoring four points that would remain unanswered. The second period went to par terre, where the American drew the advantage and converted it into a point, but the Iranian was able to push his opponent out of the ring in the final ten seconds of the last round to earn the bronze. The final podium spot was decided between Makhov and Daulet Shabanbay of Kazakhstan, who had won his first his first major international medal at the age of 14 in the heavyweight division of the 2008 Asian Championships and repeated the feat in 2009 and 2011 before moving up to the super-heavyweight class. Makhov’s experience was on display in the first period, scoring five unanswered points, but Shabanbay responded in the second round with a three-point shutout of his own. In the final period, the three-time World Champion was simply the better wrestler, and won the medal with a 3-0 score.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
The original silver medalist, Davit Modzanashvili of Georgia, was later disqualified when he was revealed to have a re-test positive for both dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (turinabol) and stanozolol. His silver medal was removed. In July 2019, the gold medalist, Artur Taymazov of Uzbekistan was similarly disqualified when a re-test of his doping sample showed evidence of dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (turinabol) metabolites. In February 2020, the IOC ruled on the final standings and medals and awarded gold medals to both Ghasemi and Makhov, while Dlagnev and Shabanbay became the bronze medalists. Dlagnev received his bronze medal on 6 March 2022 at the 2022 Big 10 Conference Wrestling Championships.

During group play, which served to eliminate just two teams (Greece and Angola), the Ukrainians appeared as the strongest team, winning all their Group A matches. In the other group, Denmark and South Korea, together responsible for winning all Olympic gold medals between 1988 and 2000, tied for first place after a 29-29 tie. After four fairly close quarter-finals, the nations remaining were defending champions Denmark, Ukraine, World Champions France, and South Korea.

The final was thus a replay of the 1996 Olympic final, which the Danish women had won.

They were led by Usain Bolt, who had won the 100-200 double in both 2008 and already in London. Yohan Blake had been second to both races in London and was the 2011 World Champion in the 100. They were without former 100 world record holder Asafa Powell, injured in the 100 final, but would lead off with Nesta Carter and Michael Frater, and seemed impregnable. The Americans had Tyson Gay, the 2007 100/200 World Champion, and Justin Gatlin, 2004 Olympic 100 gold medalist and third in the short sprint in London, but they just didn’t seem to have the firepower to challenge the Jamaicans. In addition, US sprint relay teams had shown a frequent propensity to either drop the baton or run out of the zone and had not finished at several recent major internationals. Nobody else was given a chance at gold and the bronze was wide-open.
Carter put the Jamaicans ahead on the opener, with American Trell Kimmons trailing slightly. The race was very close, however, for the next two legs, as Gatlin/Frater matched second legs in 8.9, and Gay/Blake both ran 9.0 around the final curve. But this gave the lead to Usain Bolt on the anchor leg, to be challenged by American newcomer Ryan Bailey, who had been fifth in the open 100 metres. Bailey acquitted himself well, but he could not catch Bolt. The USA finished in 37.04, matching the existing world record, but Bolt brought Jamaica home in 36.84, the first time ever under 37 seconds for the gold and a new world record. Canada came home in third, it seemed, but was disqualified for a lane violation and the bronze went to Trinidad & Tobago.
Jamaica thus defended its gold medal in the event, and Bolt had doubled up with three gold medals in the 100, 200, and sprint relay in both 2008 and 2012, the first runner ever to do so (Jamaica’s 2008 relay gold would later be rescinded for doping violation by Nesta Carter). For the Americans it seemed to be some measure of redemption as they did successfully finish the race with good baton exchanges, but were simply beaten by a faster team. However, in 2014 Tyson Gay tested positive for doping, and his penalty was applied retroactively, which caused the US relay team in this event to be disqualified, although that was not announced by the IOC until May 2015.

Brassard and Grospiron went 1-2 in the qualifying, setting up the expected battle.

The points he lost for that dropped him behind Russian Sergey Shupletsov, who led as Brassard took the course. Brassard skied conservatively and carefully, posting the third slowest time of the 16 finalists, but his turns were carved nicely, for which he received a perfect 15.0, with 5.0 from all but the French judge, which boosted him to the gold medal. Shupletsov won silver and Grospiron the bronze. A little over a year later, Shupletsov was killed in a motorcycle accident.

The British crew, Rupert Obholzer, Tim Foster, and brothers Jonny and Greg Searle, were the 1995 World runners-up and the 1994 bronze medalists, while the Searle siblings had taken Olympic gold in the coxed pairs in 1992. They won their semi-final heat with ease, as France, Italy, and Australia all faced each other in the other one. This race seemed to promise an exciting final, with only 0.37 separating them at the finish line and only 0.04 seconds between first-place France and runner-up Italy. The medal round was a little more spread out, however, although the podium finishers were all still within one second of each other. Australia, the gold medalist, had the most leeway, while France and Great Britain battled to the line for silver, which the former won by only 0.25 seconds. Even for bronze, however, the British could not relax, for the Slovenians were on their tail and missed the podium by only 0.59 seconds. Italy, meanwhile, seemed to have tired and finished sixth and last.

The honor of Olympic victory that year went to the Canadians and three of them (Malcolm Howard, Andrew Byrnes, and Brian Price) returned in 2012 to defend their title. No one counted out the strong British team either, who had 1992 Olympic champion Greg Searle on the squad as well as the home advantage of thousands of cheering fans, including Princes William and Harry, along Eton Dorney.
Germany and the United States qualified for the final during the heats, but perhaps the biggest story was the disappointing performance of the Canadians, who were dead last in their heat with a time slower than all but one of the other seven teams. They redeemed themselves in the repechage, however, coming in second place with the third fastest time of the entire event and earning a place in the final alongside Great Britain, Netherlands, and Australia. The final was a tight race; although Germany held the lead throughout the duration, perhaps every team had a chance at reaching the podium during some point of the course. For a time it looked as if Britain might overtake Germany to earn its first gold medal of the day, but they were edged out by both the Germans and the Canadians, taking home bronze. A short time later, however, the nation earned its first victory of the Games when Helen Glover and Heather Stanning took first place in the women’s coxless pairs.

Australian-born Christine Nesbitt had dominated this distance in the past two seasons much like Davis had in the men’s competition. In the 2009 season, Nesbitt had claimed the World Cup and had won the world title on the ice of the Richmond Olympic Oval. During the Olympic season, she had won all four World Cup races held. Behind Nesbitt, there was no clear number two. The Dutch skaters, Annette Gerritsen and Margot Boer, had both produced some good results, as had Japanese surprise Nao Kodaira, Canada’s Kristina Groves and Monique Angermüller of Germany. Another German, Anni Friesinger had long been a force in the event, but she had suffered of injuries earlier in the season and appeared not to be in top shape.
But the first to go below 1:17 was Laurine van Riessen, who had won a World Cup race in the previous season. Her 1:16.72 would turn out to be hard to beat. The first to do so was Gerritsen, who had recovered from a fall in the 500 m. She had gone off much faster than her team mate, struggling but prevailing, on the final curve on the tough Richmond ice, finishing in 1:16.58. Nesbitt, racing next, started much slower than the leading Dutch couple. But she preserved her strength for the final lap, converting her half-second deficit into a narrow, but sufficient, 0.02-second lead.

Pollio had already defeated Jang in round four, but he lost the first match of the final to Kornilayev. Then in the final match of the event Jang stunningly threw Kornilayev in 7:23, which gave the gold medal to Pollio in a major upset.

They had taken seven medals in the past three editions, including all titles. But world record holder, defending Olympic Champion and 1999 and 2000 World Champion Gianni Romme had been ill at the Dutch trials, and had not made the team. Reigning World Champion Bob de Jong did qualify, but performed very poorly in Salt Lake City, finishing 30th in a field of 32. This left Carl Verheijen, runner-up at the 2001 Worlds, and the relatively unknown Jochem Uytdehaage, who had captured the European Championships in January. Apart from the Dutch, most was expected from the Norwegians. Their team contained the only non-Dutchman to have medalled in a World Cup earlier that season: Eskil Ervik.
The Olympic Record from 1998 was first broken in pair five. Yet it wasn’t Nagano medalist Bart Veldkamp who did so, but his pairmate Jens Boden. The German was virtually unknown, and had never done any better than an 11th spot in a 5,000 m World Cup. His 6:21.73 in Salt Lake City turned out to be enough for a bronze medal, however. After this upset performance, Boden again settled into anonymity, never again approaching his Olympic medal achievement. The first man to beat Boden’s time was also unexpected. A convert from inline skating, Derek Parra had been a medal hope for the 1,500 m, but not in this event, having placed 15th at the most recent World Championships. But Parra’s race was excellent, skating with slightly increasing lap times the entire race to beat Romme’s world record. His 6:17.98 only lasted for a few pairs, however. Jochem Uytdehaage started out faster than the American, yet was able to keep the pace. In the end, he was more than 3 seconds ahead of the American, lowering the world record to 6:14.66.

The two main roles in the drama were played by a young Swede, Thomas Wassberg, and a Finnish veteran with an impressive collection of silver medals from international championships, the big Juha Mieto, 197 cm tall and weighing around 100 kg. Wassberg started last of the 63 participants, half a minute behind the best Norwegian, Ove Aunli. Mieto, wearing start number 54, started half a minute behind the reigning world champion at the distance, the Pole Józef Łuszczek.
Wassberg started fast, and at the 5 km mark he had caught Aunli and was in the lead, three seconds ahead of Mieto. Łuszczek also had a strong opener, only ten seconds behind the leader, closely followed by a real surprise, the 19-year old West German Jochem Behle and the 30 km winner Nikolay Zimyatov. At 10 km Wassberg had increased his lead to 4.8 seconds. Mieto, still in second place, had almost caught Łuszczek, starting half a minute in front of him, but the Pole was still in third place, now 30 seconds behind the leader. Yevgeny Belyayev had advanced from 11th to fourth., and his teammate Zimyatov was down in sixth place. Aunli had been able to adjust his speed and was on Wassberg’s heels, advancing from 13th to fifth place. Only two seconds separated the four skiers behind Wassberg and Mieto 5 km from home. Young Behle had dropped down to ninth and was out of contention for the medals.
First of the favorites to finish was Zimyatov, looking very fresh at the finish and beating Belyayev’s final time by 12 seconds. But Mieto finished even faster. The Finn had passed Łuszczek, quickly left the Pole behind, and crossed the finish line in 41:57.64, beating Zimyatov’s time by 36 seconds. Could Wassberg respond to Mieto’s finish? The Swede, still skiing together with Aunli, was told 500 m from home that he had a one second lead over Mieto, and, fighting desperately, crossed the finish line in 41:57.63. He had won by the closest possible margin, one hundredth of a second! Aunli secured the bronze medal for Norway, beating Zimyatov by 5 seconds.
Wassberg, then 23, had made his Olympic début in 1976 as a teenager. Before the 1978 World Championships, he was severely injured in a car accident, but fought his way back to the international elite by hard and determined work. Mieto, starting in his third Olympics, ended his career with three individual silver medals in international championships, his 1976 Olympics relay gold medal his only championship victory. In 2007, this extremely popular athlete, who had six wins at Holmenkollen from 1973-1978, was elected a member of the Finnish parliament. At the 1972 Olympics he was involved in another close duel, losing the bronze medal by a margin of 0.06 seconds in the 15 km race. Wassberg proposed to Mieto that they could cut their medals in two parts and then melt them together as a mixed gold-silver medal. Mieto politely thanked him, but said no to the idea, and ended the 1980 season by winning the cross-country World Cup for the second time in a row. The International Skiing Federation (FIS) decided shortly after the 1980 Olympics that all times in cross-country races would henceforth be rounded to the nearest tenth of a second.

They boasted an impressive lineup: three of the men, Tom James, Pete Reed, and Andrew Triggs Hodge, returned from the 2008 squad to claim another title. Reed and Triggs Hodge were the runners up in the coxless pairs at the last three World Championships, but were pulled from that event to row in the fours because it was believed (correctly, as it turned out) that the British would be unable to defeat the unstoppable New Zealand duo of Eric Murray and Hamish Bond in the pairs. James, meanwhile, was one of the four members of the World Championship-winning boat and was joined by teammate Alex Gregory, also a 2009 World Champion in the event, to round out the quartet.
Britain’s greatest rivals in the fours were the Australians, who were runners-up in Beijing and bronze medalists at the most recent World Championships. Their most notable rower, Drew Ginn, had an impressive list of achievements going back to his gold medal in the event from the 1996 Summer Olympics, although he had earned many more Olympic and World Championship medals in the coxless pairs. His compatriots, James Chapman, Joshua Dunkley-Smith, and William Lockwood, were less experienced, but had banded together to defeat the British in the Samsung World Rowing Cup shortly before the Games.
The two nations easily overcame their rivals in the heats and semi-finals and placed themselves in a class of their own to compete for gold. In the final, Britain took a short lead early on but was never able to entirely shake the Australians, who at no point trailed by more than half a length. Not even a desperate push from the Australians at the end, however, could stop the Britons, who took the gold after a well-raced match, leaving their rivals to accept silver. The United States had an impressive run as well in the event, earning bronze by finishing the course over four seconds faster than their nearest competitor.

Together Rousseau, Kelly, and Hartwell had been on the podium at the Worlds in 1994-95. In 1996, the third podium spot was taken by the surprising bronze medalist, Takanobu Jumonji of Japan. Jumonji received 41 million ¥ for his medal from various Japanese cycling associations.

The Pole had been given a life ban by his national federation following a conviction for assault and only returned to the ring when the ban was commuted shortly before the Tokyo Games. Kasprzyk, though fighting with a broken thumb suffered in his first fight, had beaten another top rated fighter in Italy’s Silvano Bertini in the semi-final and repeated the trick with a shock victory against Tamulis. Kasprzyk returned to the Olympic Games in 1968 but was eliminated in his opening contest.

The world record holder, Arturo Barrios (MEX), was in the race, as was 1991 World Champion Moses Tanui (KEN) and World runner-up Richard Chelimo (KEN). Also back was 1990 European Champion and 1988 silver medalist, Salvatore Antibo of Italy. Chelimo set the pace early in the final, dropping all but seven runners by the eighth lap. By the 16th lap, Chelimo still led, now only accompanied by Morocco’s Khalid Skah, twice International Cross-Country champion. By the 19th lap, these two were lapping runners and one of the runners they came upon on the 22nd lap was Morocco’s Hammou Boutayeb. Though he was lapped he suddenly found the strength to run with Chelimo and Skah, to the detriment of Chelimo. Writing in Track & Field News, Cordner Nelson noted, “In the next lap and a half, Boutayeb committed unarmed assault.” He bumped Chelimo several times, cut him off at least twice, and made him run over and around him several times. Shortly before the bell, IAAF Technical Delegate Carl-Gustaf Tollemar ran onto the track to warn Boutayeb to stop his tactics and appeared to try to stop him, to no avail. On the last lap, Skah was the fresher runner, and outsprinted Chelimo, his tank dry from having to fight off Boutayeb’s assaults. Boutayeb dropped out on the last lap. Shortly after the finish, Skah began a victory lap that was greeted by boos and detritus being thrown at him from the stands. Before he had finished the lap, the IAAF had disqualified him and declared Chelimo the winner. Moroccan officials immediately appealed the ruling, and the next day Skah was reinstated. On the victory podium two days later, the chorus of derision on the victory lap seemed mild compared to the abuse heaped on Skah.

In the first two rounds at Seoul, Lewis had the fastest times. The two semis were won by Reynolds and Lewis, with 1987 World Champion Thomas Schönlebe (GDR) failing to qualify. In the final, Everett opened up early and led to 200 metres. Lewis then took the lead but Reynolds was closing. His last 100 was the fastest but he narrowly missed catching Lewis, who won the gold.

The reigning Olympic champion returned in 2018, becoming the only freestyle skier to compete in six editions of the Games and hoping to defend her title. Aerials are often, however, an unpredictable sport, and she faced many viable challengers in her quest for gold. The most consistent of these was probably China’s Xu Mengtao, the runner up in 2014 and the bronze medalist at the last two editions of the World Championships. Ashley Caldwell of the United States was the reigning World Champion, while Australia’s Laura Peel had taken the title in 2015.
The aerials’ unpredictability left Russia’s Aleksandra Orlova as the top qualifier, with Caldwell failing to make the final even after the second qualification round. Orlova’s closest competitor was the relatively unknown Anna Guskova of Belarus, while Xu rounded out the top three. Huskova’s first jump in the final proved that her placing was no fluke, as she came out significantly ahead of the other competitors to take the first round. Xu, who had been behind Huskova, came into the second round determined, but failed to execute her landing properly and was eliminated from the tournament, as was Orlova. Huskova also seemed shaky, however, finishing the round in fourth behind Kong Fanyu and Zhang Xin, both unheralded skiers from China, and Peel. In the end, however, Huskova pulled off the best performance of the finals that, while not flawless, was sufficient to earn her the gold medal and keep the Olympic title in her country’s possession. Her teammate Tsuper, however, attempted to finish with the same jump that had earned her gold four years earlier, but crashed on the landing and was out of the competition. Zhang also performed very well, but was edged out by Huskova and thus settled for silver, while Kong was able take bronze with a safe, but successful jump that placed her ahead of the more challenging, but failed executions of the remainder of the field.

The Cuban was a master of the technical side of boxing and had won every major competition he had entered since 1999.
His chances were further helped when world silver medallist Pichai Sayota failed to qualify for Athens.
The wildcard in the draw was British fighter Amir Khan who, at 17, was too young to even contest his national championships. His victory at the World Junior Championship had forced the hand of Great Britain’s selectors and he duly repaid them by winning the final qualifying tournament. Khan then defeated the champions of Europe and Asia in his unexpected progression to the Olympic final.
The young Briton fought well but the experience gained by the Cuban in his years at the top of amateur boxing proved far too much for Khan and Kindelan’s expertise helped him retain the Olympic title with a margin of 8 points. An illustration of the two fighters’ relative experience was that while the Olympic final was only Khan’s 14th senior fight it was the 330th of Kindelan’s career.
This was the to be the last major fight of the Cuban’s career and he then moved into coaching and was for a time involved in the British coaching programme. Khan on the other hand turned professional and became a world champion in the light-welterweight division.

Forecasting the event was futile.
In the final Cheptegei controlled the race throughout, taking the early lead, and then leading for several laps with teammate Jacob Kiplimo. Kiplimo led through 2,300 metres before Cheptegei went to the lead, although he allowed Kenyan Nicholas Kipkorir Kimeli to lead briefly.

Allman was the next-to-last thrower in round one, and her 68.98 took the lead. It would be her best mark of the competition, but it would hold up and bring her the gold medal.

In the qualifying round each team was allowed six competitors, with five to compete on each apparatus, and the best four of five scores counting for each apparatus. Qualifying scores did not carry over to the final round. In the final, each team had six gymnasts, with three allowed to compete on each apparatus, all three scores counting, which was termed the 6/3/3 rule.
This was expected to be a battle between the United States and China, who had won the last two World titles. However, controversy in this event began two weeks before the Olympics when The New York Times posted an article looking at the ages of several of the Chinese gymnasts, and using Chinese sources, noted that several of them were under the age limit of 16-years-old. The Chinese Gymnastics Federation then produced passports verifying their ages, which were accepted by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), although there was abundant evidence that the gymnasts were not actually old enough to compete by FIG rules. The Chinese team’s girls also averaged only 145 cm tall and 35 kg in weight, far smaller than the American team.
The Chinese had a history of sneaking underage gymnasts into the competition, with the case of Dong Fangxiao at the 2000 Olympics the most notable one. In 2008 she was discovered to have been underage in 2000 and the Chinese lost their team bronze medal from the Sydney Olympics. Despite all this all the Chinese gymnasts were allowed to compete. The start time for the events was not even changed which may have caused several of them to be up past their bedtime.
The USA and China were paired together on the rotations in the final round. The US took the lead on the first rotation, the vault, but China moved ahead on the uneven bars, and was unstoppable on balance beam and floor exercise, winning the gold medal by almost 2½ points. The two nations were the class of the event, as the United States was 5 points ahead of bronze-medal winning Romania.
The IOC declined to investigate the Chinese gymnasts’ ages, leaving it to the FIG to do so. In October 2008 the FIG declared that the Chinese documents proved that all the gymnasts were old enough to compete, with Chinese officials blaming the controversy on administrative errors.

After all, Jung had won the last three European Championships, was world ranked at number one and was the holder of all three of the sport’s Grand Slam events. The only title Jung did not hold was that of the 2014 World Equestrian Games where he won silver behind compatriot Sandra Auffarth.
Jung was fifth after the dressage with William Fox-Pitt (GBR) leading the field ahead of Australia’s Christopher Burton. Fox-Pitt had only just recovered from a serious head injury suffered in an event in France in October 2015 which left him in a coma for two weeks. The Briton’s chance of a fairy tale victory was lost with a refusal on the cross-country phase. The leaders after the cross-country were the only three combinations to have ridden clear and inside the time limit. Burton led the field ahead of Jung and Astier Nicolas of France, with 1984 and 1988 champion Mark Todd of New Zealand just behind them and threatening to win a medal at age 60. Sadly for Todd, a nightmare first round of jumping removed him from contention and Burton also suffered disappointment as he dropped from first to third.
In the final phase of jumping Phillip Dutton of the USA produced a clear round which meant that he overtook Burton and won his first Olympic medal for 16 years - but the gold was to be decided between Jung and Nicolas. First up was Nicolas who hit a rail down and was marginally over the time allowed as well. This meant Jung would win as long as he did not have two fences down – something that never looked like happening. At the 2012 London Games, Jung became the first gold medallist to finish an Olympic eventing competition on his dressage score. They repeated that performance in Brazil with another perfect round in the final show jumping phase.

By the time Masahiko Harada stood at the top of the jump he knew what he had to do to ensure a Japanese victory. A jump of around 105 m would be enough and since he had made a leap of 122 m in the first round this appeared to be a relative formality. Instead the jump turned into a disaster as he mistimed his leap and landed at just 97.5 m.

Despite a flurry of disqualifications and advances in the heats and quarter-finals, most of the favorites reached the semi-finals. One casualty was Korea’s Park Jang-Hyuk. In his quarter-final, he collided with Pietro Sighel. While spinning on the ice, Wu Dajing skated into his hand, causing a serious injury that required 12 stitches, leaving him unable to race the semi-finals (to which he as advanced).
Hwang and Ren seemed to proceed from the first semi-finals, but Hwang was judged to have impeded Li Wenlong in his move overtaking Ren and Li, and was relegated. The second semi-final also ended badly for the South Koreans. The Liu brothers dominated much of the race, but after Lee June-Seo had overtaken Shaoang, he blocked the Hungarian’s attempt to comeback, and was also penalized.
This left the final a Chinese affair, with Ren, Li and Wu Dajing, as well as the Chinese-Hungarian Liu brothers. Wu was leading the race when it was halted, as a piece from of the skates of Li had broken off and damaged the ice. In the restarted race, Ren was the early leader, but was passed by Sándor Shaolin with four laps to go, at which point Wu and Shaoang had lost touch with the others. Liu only just held on until the finish line, crossing it falling and cheering. But after some agonizing minutes waiting for the referee to review the race, Liu was penalized for an overtaking infringement earlier in the race, giving Ren his second gold medal of the Games. As a minor consolation for Hungary, this moved Shaoang up to bronze.
Another notable competitor was Furkan Akar. The 19-year-old Turkish skater made his country’s first Olympic appearance in short-track. Benefiting from disqualifications in his heat and quarter-final, he eventually reaced the B-final, recording a remarkable sixth place in the final standings, the best ever for a Turkish competitor in any sport at the Olympic Winter Games.

The defending Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara was a potential challenger as well, but the crash he suffered during the road race several days earlier hampered his speed during the time trial and he was never a factor for the podium.
There were no surprises in the race: Wiggins dominated the course throughout and Martin came in with a comfortable second-place finish. Wiggins’ teammate Christopher Froome, who had come in second overall at the most recent Tour de France, took home the bronze. Wiggins’ victory gave him the highest lifetime total of medals for a British Olympian with seven, although the man he surpassed, rower Steven Redgrave, still held the title of most successful Olympian with five gold medals compared to Wiggins’ four.

Yugoslavia had defeated the Soviets (20-18), but lost to the West Germans (18-17), who in turn had lost to the USSR (18-16). Yugoslavia’s loss in the final group match came as a surprise to the reigning Olympic champions, but they played without focus and shot poorly - missing the Olympic final by just one goal. This put the matter down to goal difference. That meant the advantage went to the Soviet Union, which had demolished Canada 25-9 and Japan 26-16, while the other teams had scored more modest victories against these teams. In the other pool, Romania was clearly standing out, winning three matches while drawing one (the Match against Tunisia was cancelled as they withdrew due to the African boycott).

As Coachman had cleared the height in her first try, she was awarded the gold ahead of Tyler. This was unlucky for the British woman, who had also won a silver medal (as Dorothy Odam) in 1936. Back then, she had cleared the winning height in fewer attempts, but the rules in Berlin called for a jump-off, which she lost.

In 2003 she stunned the athletics world by winning London in 2-15:25, a mark that would place her highly in most major men’s marathons.
The race began at Marathon, and ran point-to-point to the Olympic Stadium in Athina, although it was not exactly the same course as that used for the 1896 Olympic marathon. It started at 6 PM, but the day was brutally hot, with temperatures reaching 35° C. (95° F.) Given that weather nobody expected fast times. By 20 km. a pack of five runners held the lead, which included Radcliffe, Catherine Ndereba of Kenya, Mizuki Noguchi and Reiko Tosa of Japan, and Elfenesh Alemu of Ethiopia. Noguchi attached at 25 km. on an uphill stretch of the course, and quickly opened a lead of 23 seconds over Alemu, with Radcliffe trailing. Radcliffe would drop out at 36 km. Noguchi held her narrow lead to the finish, winning by 12 seconds over Ndereba.

These included six players each from both Africa and Latin America, 11 each from Asia and Europe, and three each from both North America and Oceania.

At first it was moved to Friday, but the Super G was scheduled for that day, and the IOC preferred not to postpone races from the original schedule, so the super combined, which differs from the former combined event as only one slalom heat is raced, was contested on Sunday, 21 February.
The favorites were Aksel Lund Svindal, after gold in the Super G and silver in the downhill, he was also the reigning world champion in super combined, and Bode Miller, after a silver in the Super G and bronze in the downhill, and having won the World Cup super combined at Wengen earlier in the winter. Ivica Kostelić, who finished the downhill event on Monday in 18th place, and Benjamin Raich were also considered challengers. Kostelić won silver at Torino in 2006, had finished third in the 2009-10 World Cup super combined, which finished before Vancouver, and had won the last combined event at Kitzbühel about one month prior to the Games. Raich had already won the 2009-10 World Cup in the event and had one win at Val d’Isère. The first of the four combined events held in the seasonal World Cup was won by Carlo Janka at Beaver Creek. Janka had also won the combined World Cup in 2008-09 and placed second in 2009-10. Silvan Zurbriggen, second in the 2008-09 combined World Cup, and Ted Ligety, gold medalist from Torino, were also given a shot. The 2006 bronze medalist Rainer Schönfelder (ACL tear) as well as 2007 World Champion Daniel Albrecht, who had crashed horrifically in the downhill at Kitzbühel in January 2009, failed to compete in Vancouver.
The downhill saw Aksel Lund Svindal leading with 1:53.15, 0.39 seconds ahead of Dominik Paris and 0.50 seconds ahead of Carlo Janka. Ted Ligety, who finished 15th in the downhill section, set the standard in what would be the fastest slalom time, resulting in a combined time of 2:45.82. His lead held until Ivica Kostelić, starting with a 0.86 second advantage ahead of Ligety, raced to a combined time of 2:45.20 on the slalom course designed by his father. Starting two skiers later, Bode Miller skied an almost perfect slalom to take over the lead by 0.33 seconds ahead of Kostelić. Silvan Zurbrigen, skiing next, posted a combined time of 2:45.32 to put him into the bronze medal position. The final four skiers were, arguably, more downhill specialists, and had big leads over Miller after the downhill section. The first of the four, downhill gold medallist Didier Défago went out after missing a gate. Janka threatened for a while, but his time of 2:45.54 finished just outside the medals. The final two skiers, Paris and Svindal, both missed gates and failed to finish, so Bode Miller won his first Olympic gold medal at his third Games. With Miller Head won its third gold medal (and eighth in total) at this Games, while Kostelić won the first medal for Fischer with silver and Zurbriggen won bronze for Rossignol.

Hungary was World Champion in 1975, while the Soviets had won in 1973 and 1974. But Hungary was not considered to be as strong as in recent years. In the fencing segment, the Soviets were competing against Great Britain when something odd was noticed. Boris Onishchenko fought Adrian Parker and his sword registered a hit although he did not appear to have come close to one. In the next match against Jim Fox, the same thing occurred. The British requested that Onishchenko’s sword be inspected and it was found to be rigged so that it could register a hit even when one had not been made. Onishchenko was disqualified which resulted in the elimination of the Soviet team. Onishchenko was taken away from the Olympic Village and was never seen again internationally. The world media gave him one of the most apt nicknames ever – Boris Dis-onishchenko.
With the Soviets eliminated, Czechoslovakia took the lead after the second phase and led thru the swimming. But Great Britain was very strong in the run and they won that phase by a large margin, enough to pull them ahead of the Czechs and into the gold medal. Czechoslovakia won the silver, while Hungary edged out Poland for the bronze. Hungary would been relative easy winners but for a disastrous show jumping section. One of the Hungarians had his round ruined when he failed to tighten the chin strap on his riding hat  and it slipped over his eyes. Great Britain and Czechoslovakia had never before won a medal in modern pentathlon either at the Olympics or the World Championships, although Britain had been fourth at the 1975 World Championships, with Fox winning an individual bronze.

Haase had competed at the Worlds since 1956, but had never placed better than sixth at any distance, with a best overall finish of sixth in 1958. Rylova was in the seventh pair, but could post only 46.2, which would leave her out of the medals. The bronze medal was secured in the ninth pair, when Jeanne Ashworth, many-time American champion, finished in 46.1. Haase never bettered her time of 45.9 and never again won a distance race at a major international. Her gold medal was the first ever won by any athlete from the GDR (East Germany).

He led two International Himalaya Expeditions, one in 1930 and one in 1934. The aim of the first was to climb Kangchenjunga – the third highest mountain in the world. Although that objective was not met, several geological and medical experiments had been useful, and the expedition was widely publicized. Additionally, members of the expedition reached the top of the Jongsong, which at 7,462 m was the highest peak to have been climbed at the time.
An important member of the expedition had been Oskar’s wife, Hettie Dyhrenfurth (née Heymann). With the rise of the Nazi party in the early 1930s, the Jewish couple decided to apply for Swiss citizenship. Their 1934 expedition led them to the Gasherbrum ()Hidden Peak)), reaching 6,900 m, and the Sia Kangri. At the latter mountain, Hettie reached 7,442 m, setting a new world altitude record for women which she only lost to Claude Kogan in 1954.
The Dyhrenfurths were unanimously awarded the gold medal for alpinism, citing their expeditions to the Himalaya, although technically only the 1934 expedition was eligible. This decision was remarkable as the Germans probably didn’t like their former citizens winning this award. As a result, the prize was barely mentioned in any German or even Swiss publications, much to the chagrin of Oskar Dyhrenfurth.

The top two seeds also progressed to the quarter-final and top seed Espinoza came through to the last four after a sudden-death win, and her semi-final against Jackie Galloway of the USA was even closer. After four rounds it was 0-0 and the top seed won though on the superiority ruling.
In the other half of the draw Zheng and Walkden met in the semi-final meaning the top four seeds contested the two semis. After a very close contest that went to sudden-death, Zheng  won it with a head kick. Walkden had some consolation by taking the bronze medal while Galloway won the other bronze medal match. Zheng controlled the final against the two-time Olympic medallist Maria Espinoza and ran out the 5-1 winner. Espinoza’s silver added to her gold in Beijing and bronze in London for a full set of medals.

The Europeans went extinct after 1973, but three members of the crew from the Netherlands, Liesbeth Vosmaer-de Bruin, Hette Borrias, and Myriam van Rooyen-Steenman, had been among the final champions from that tournament. A better metric, however, might have been the World Championships, in which East Germany was undefeated. They sent a new lineup to the 1976 Summer Olympics, but were still favored to take the inaugural title.
The opening heats were won by East Germany and Bulgaria, the latter of whom had captured silver at the 1975 World Championships with almost the same lineup that they brought to Montreal. These two nations also had the two best times overall in round one. In the final, however, the East Germans demonstrated the prowess that they had displayed at the World Championships and took gold with ease, over three seconds ahead of the Bulgarians. The Soviet Union, who had not seen a major international podium in the event since they won the 1972 European Championships, captured bronze. Bulgaria’s silver medal was one of its first three Olympic rowing medals, as the nation’s women won the double sculls and the coxless pairs.

When Poltoranin pulled away a few kilometers later, the Finn looked like a sure winner, but the decision when to change his skies now became a tactical and decisive factor. Already with new skies, Bolshunov came back and closed the gap on Niskanen, which had increased to 25 seconds at one stage. By the time Niskanen had changed his skies at 42 km, Bolshunov had increased his lead to 14 seconds. But now it was Niskanen’s turn to chase and close in on Bolshunov. Niskanen’s tactics turned out to be the better one: With fresh skies and obviously the greater stamina, he started his final attack with just 1 km to go as Bolshunov could do nothing to counter the Finn’s attack. Niskanen celebrated the biggest individual success of his career, when he crossed the finish line after 2-08:22.1.

Michael Spinks would hold a version of the light-heavyweight title through 1985 when he moved up to the heavies and defeated Larry Holmes to win the IBF heavyweight crown, the first light-heavyweight champion to move on to become heavyweight world champ. Spinks fought through 1988, winning his first 31 fights, but he retired after losing a heavyweight title fight that year to Mike Tyson.

A good example of this is the boxer Ted Morgan. Although he had been born in England, his family had emigrated to New Zealand when he was a baby and had never left his adopted country since. On the long boat journey to Europe a lack of exercise meant that he gained enough weight to force him to move from the lightweight division, in which he was national champion, to the welterweights. Arriving in England, where the New Zealanders had based their training camp, he suffered a potentially serious setback when sparring with English professional Ernie Rice. His left hand smacked into Rice’s elbow and he suffered a dislocated knuckle. Although treatment by Arthur Porritt, the former New Zealand sprinter and 100 m bronze medalist in Paris, mitigated the effects of the injury he was unable to use his left hand to full effectiveness throughout the tournament.
Despite his injury, he dispatched Johansson of Sweden via a second round knockout in his first contest; he also outpointed French and Italian opponents on his way to the final. Morgan’s opponent for the gold was Raúl Landini, an Argentinean noted for his ability to knock out opponents. The New Zealander never allowed his opponent enough room to tee off his punches and comfortably outboxed Landini to claim the decision. Morgan had other reasons to remember his Olympic adventure, a shipboard romance with fellow New Zealand competitor Norma Wilson led to one of the first marriages between Olympians.
The American entrant in this division was New York’s Tommy Lown. Lown was noted for singing “Mother Macree”, a popular song of the time, after winning his contests. In Amsterdam he lost his first bout and remained silent.

One athlete who would not compete in London was Hal Davis, who would have been favored in either 1940 or 1944 if the Olympics had not been lost to the war. An unusual thing happened at the US Olympic Trials. The heavy favorite in the high hurdles was Harrison Dillard, who had not lost a hurdle race in several years, but he hit a hurdle in the final of the Trials and did not finish. Fortunately for him, he had also entered the 100 metres and made the team in that event behind Patton and Ewell. In the Olympic final, Patton got off to a disastrous start and was not a factor. Dillard led from start to finish with Ewell closing quickly to get the silver medal, LaBeach in third.

One of the team members, Ali Dara, had been on the golden Indian team of 1936. All four ranked teams made the semis, although the Brits were held to a goalless draw by Switzerland, and Pakistan crushed the Dutch 6-1 in their group match. The semi-finals were close, and British observers considered the Indians to be lucky to get away with a 2-1 win against the Dutch. With Britain beating Pakistan, the gold medal match would finally see India play the Britons. Completely focused on its defence, Britain was unable to keep up with the fast-paced Indians, and they lost it 4-0. The bronze went to the Netherlands, beating Pakistan 4-1 in a replay of the first 3rd place match, which had ended in a draw.

After her double gold in the 3 and 5 km, all eyes were on Schouten to make it three golds. However, given the less predictable nature of the event, other names were also expected to do well. This included two-time world champion Ivanie Blondin, inline skating great Francesca Lollobrigida, Korea’s Kim Bo-Reum, as well as Schouten’s teammate Marijke Groenewoud, who had surprisingly claimed the 2021 world title when Schouten was held up in the final sprint.
The semi-finals were rather nervous. In the first, Groenwoud fell, but she was able to return to the group and qualify for the final. That could not be said for defending champion Nana Takagi. After her dramatic fall earlier in the team pursuit, she again fell in the second semi-final.
In the final, the race was fairly compact, but saw Groenewoud fall again and lose contact. With two laps left, an intact pack (save for Groenewoud) started the final sprint. Valérie Maltais increased the speed, hoping to launch her teammate Blondin to victory. At the bell, Schouten had taken the lead, followed by Blondin and Lollobrigida. The Italian briefly lost her balance, leaving Blondin in front going into the final curve. With 50 m to go, Schouten passed the Canadian, crossing the line first, while Lollobrigida was just too late to join the fight for gold and came in third.
By winning her third gold and fourth medal in Beijing, Schouten became the most successful Dutch Winter Olympian ever at a single Games, beating three-time champions Ard Schenk and Yvonne van Gennip.

It was an individual variant of the military ski patrol competition, an official medal sport in 1924, and organized as a demonstration sport on several earlier Olympic occasions. The first World Championships were organized in Saalfelden, Austria in 1958 with Adolf Wiklund from Sweden as the first champion. One year later the Soviets took a double in Courmayeur, Italy, with Vladimir Melanin as winner and Dmitry Sokolov in second place.
The Olympic biathlon competition in 1960 was contested over 20 km with 20 shots fired over four different ranges: 200m, 250m, 150m and 100m. The first three series were fired from a prone position, the last standing. Each missed target gave a two minute penalty, which was added to the final time. In 1967 the penalty for each missed target was reduced from two to one minute. Also the weapon was different from the small board rifle in use nowadays. The biathletes at that time used a high-power center fire rifle, normally caliber 7,62 mm. The normal start interval in those days was two minutes, but due to very mild temperatures the intervals were reduced to one minute for the first Olympic event.
Before the final five standing shots, only three participants had been able to hit all 15 targets, and those three held the medal positions. Aleksandr Privalov from the Soviet Union had a lead of over two minutes on the Swede Klas Lestander, and the Norwegian 38-year-old veteran Henry Hermansen followed closely in third place. But the final standing shooting turned out to be decisive. Lestander once again made 5 hits, the only competitor to hit all 20 targets, and would finish as Olympic champion, even if his cross country time was the 15th best of the day out of 30 competitors. Privalov missed three times, was penalized with six minutes, and was also passed in the final stage by the Finn Antti Tyrväinen, who had two missed targets on the first two shooting phases, but was able to hit his last 10 targets. For Hermansen, the final shooting phase was even worse -  he missed four shots and went down to 10th place overall.
The fastest skier of the day, the French cross country specialist Victor Arbez, had a cross-country time almost 7 1/2 minutes better than the Olympic Champion Lestander, but was only able to hit 2 of his 20 targets. He was penalized 36 minutes and ended up placing 25th out of the 30 competitors.
The Olympic Champion Klas Lestander was 28, and came from the little village Arjeplog in the Lapland area in the far north of Sweden. He ended his athletic career after being a member of the Swedish relay team that placed third at the 1961 World Biathlon Championships. At that time, the relay event was not an official championships event.

The exhibits for the two competitions “Town Planning” and “Architectural Design” were identical, but were assessed separately for both categories. Two works by Italian architects were shown “hors concours”. All six medals were awarded.
For the competition in Architectural Design the gold medal went to Dutch architect Jan Wils for Olympisch Stadion van Amsterdam (Olympic Stadium at Amsterdam). He was the only architect to win an Olympic medal with a design that was realized for the same Olympics. One of its notable features is the “Marathontoren” (Marathon gate), a 40 m high tower. Wils planned to have a fire burn on top of this tower throughout the Olympics. A traditional Greek symbol, the socialist Wils supposedly used fire to juxtapose his tower against church towers, as Dutch Christian politicians had been largely opposed to holding the “heathen” Olympics in the Netherlands.
The silver medal went to Danish architect Ejnar Mindedal Rasmussen for Swimming Pool in Ollerup, and the bronze medal was earned by French Jacques Lambert, who had already received the silver medal for the same work in the other architectural category, town planning.

Pilczuk failed to make the US Olympic team but the Americans, in the shape of Gary Hall, Jr. and Anthony Ervin, were still seen as Popov’s closest rivals. Popov broke Tom Jager’s  longstanding world record in March 2000 then saw Hall also go under the old mark at the US trials.

Gorman and Andreasen held on to finish second and third, respectively, as the Americans swept the medals, the last medal sweep in diving at the Olympics.

A potentially disastrous accident occurred in heat two of this event.  At the beginning of the sprint, Mr. Harry Venn, a judge in the walking contests, wandered onto the track and Guillaume Coeckelberg (BEL) collided with him.  Coeckelberg was thrown from his bike, and struck his head on the concrete curb of the track.  Fortunately, neither was severely injured and Coeckelberg was able to remount and finish the race and qualify for the final as a result of having led the race for a sufficient number of laps.
The track was wet from rains at the start of the final of this event and intermittent rain saturated the riders for most of the race, which was marred by multiple punctures and accidents.  At 13 miles, Meredith was involved in a crash with Walter Andrews and D. C. Robertson.  He remounted but was off the back and could never rejoin the leading group.  Meredith was lapped at 62 laps, and he dismounted within the next mile.  The half-way mark (50 km.) was covered in 1-16:47.2, with Sydney Bailey (GBR) leading.
At 70 kilometres (115 laps) the leading pack numbered seven, including Charles Bartlett.  But Bartlett punctured, only to be paced back to the pack in eight laps by the Canadian, Harry Young.  The final lap came down to a pack of four - Bartlett, Charles Denny, Octave Lapize, and Billy Pett.  With three British riders, Lapize stood little chance, and the Brits paced the quick sprinting Bartlett, leading him out for the final sprint, which he won by about one wheel to earn the Prince of Wales Cup.  Bartlett had no other major international titles but won the NCU 50-mile tandem-paced championship in 1908 and 1909.  His time in winning this race was a world record, bettering the mark of 2-49:00.8 set by Capelle in Dijon, France on 20 October 1898.
Although Octave Lapize “only” earned the bronze medal, in 1910 he became the first former Olympic rider to win the Tour de France.

(117.37 miles) mass start race.,na,"The US-led boycott definitely affected this event as the favorite in the race could not compete.  That was Greg LeMond, the first great American road cyclist at the international level. In 1979, LeMond had won the Under-23 World Championships road race, and also won silver and bronze medals on the track at that event, although he was only 18-years-old. He would later become one of the greatest professional cyclists ever, winning the Tour de France in 1986, 1989-90. The favorite in LeMond’s absence was Sergey Sukhoruchenkov (USSR), who had dominated the 1979 season and won the Peace Race, known as the “Tour de France of Eastern Europe.” The home rider did not disappoint. He first rode away on the third lap, but was joined by a group of riders two laps later. The leading pack included two former World Champions, Swiss Gilbert Glaus (1978) and Italian Gianni Giacomini (1979). Sukhoruchenkov broke away again with 32 km. remaining and won by almost three minutes, with fourth place 7:44 in arrears, the largest margin of victory since the event had become a mass start race in 1936.
Far from the leading pack finished Irish rider Stephen Roche, slightly hampered by a knee injury. Seven years later, he would stun the cycling world by winning the World Championship, the Tour de France, and the Giro d’Italia in the same year, a feat only achieved one other time, by cycling legend Eddy Merckx.

But Carnell did not have the highest score in this event.  That honor was left to British shooter Philip Plater, who is not actually considered to have even taken part.
The limit for entrants per nation in all individual shooting events was 12.  But the entry forms for George Barnes, the eventual bronze medalist, were lost, and Plater was named as the 12th British entrant in his place.  However, an extension of the deadline for entries was made and Barnes’s application was eventually accepted.  On the day of the competition, the British team officials lost count of the number of British shooters who had competed in this event.  With only -hour to go before the time limit, they called on Plater to shoot, thinking he was the 12th British shooter in the small-bore rifle when, in fact, he was the 13th - one beyond the limit.  In varying light, a gusty wind, and fine drizzle, he fired his 80 rounds in less than 30 minutes, scoring 391, the leading score and a new world record.  In the initial results issued by the National Rifle Association, and published in The Sporting Life, Plater was listed as the winner.
But the error of Britain having 13 competitors was then discovered and it took several days to sort out the error.  It was not certain if Plater’s or Barnes’ mark would be deleted from the official results, but eventually Plater was declared an unofficial entrant and not given an Olympic medal.  But in October 1908, Philip Plater was presented a special gold medal and a record diploma by the British Olympic Council.

His main rivals for the title were Nagano champion Pierre Leuders of Canada, the two World Cup winning Swiss sleds of Martin Annen  (2001) and Christian Reich (2000) and the fast improving USA I bob driven by Todd Hays  who enjoyed home advantage on the Park City track. 
Langen, who had won everything the sport had to offer except the Olympic two-man title, had not contested all of the season’s World Cup races but had shown sparkling form in those in which he had raced, with three wins and a second place from his four outings.
The first blow was struck by Reich in Switzerland I when he opened a tiny advantage of 0.02 of a second ahead of Langen in the first run with Switzerland II the same margin behind the Germans in third. As the second Swiss bob slipped a bit further back with each run, the gap between the two leaders closed by a hundredth on both the second and third runs until the two teams were absolutely level with only the final run to go. Langen and last-minute substitute brakeman Markus Zimmerman could not match the Swiss start times throughout the competition and the final run was no exception. The Swiss advantage was a clear one at the top of the run but Langen’s driving made up for the relatively poor start and he gradually gained the time required to clinch gold. At the finish he was 0.09 faster than Reich on the final run and in the overall standings. The second string Swiss crew denied the home crowd an American medal by finishing just 0.03 ahead of USA I with defending champion Leuders of Canada back in fifth.
The fastest starts of the entire event were set by the Jamaican crew of Winston Watt and brakeman Lascelles Brown. By 2006 Brown had changed nations and partnered Leuders in the Canadian bob.

Hoppe did in fact lead after the first run but his hopes of retaining the title were ruined in the controversial second run. Seeding of the top fifteen crews had not yet been introduced at the Olympics and by the time East Germany I competed the track was in less than perfect condition. Some of the top crews, including the GDR and the half way leaders from the Soviet Union filed a protest and asked for the results of the first day to be set aside. Their arguments centered on the fact that strong winds had blown dust and dirt onto the track and had left the track in a condition which was unfair to later runners. Hoppe had a strong case to say that the time he lost on the difficult second run had a material effect on the result as he dropped a second and a quarter on that run to the Soviet gold medallists. The Soviets won the title only by three quarters of a second. Hoppe was also critical of the novice crews that littered the event and complained that the damage to the track caused by inexperienced drivers had also had an effect on the performance of other teams.
The winner of the Soviet Union’s one and only Olympic bobsleigh title, Jānis Ķipurs, was a Latvian whose bob was painted in Latvian national colours. Four years later he would carry the Latvian flag in the opening ceremony in Albertville. A record number of 41 teams from 23 countries slid down the Calgary track with a number of unlikely countries fielding sleds. Oceanian representation came from Australia and New Zealand and the first teams appeared from the Caribbean.  Mexico’s two sled contingent was populated by a family of four brothers whilst Prince Albert of Monaco piloted his nation’s first entry. The US Virgin Islands number one bob were the last of the thirty-eight finishers but it is worth noting that their team consisted of fifty-year-old John Reeve and John Foster who turned fifty a week after the Games ended.

As with all Alpine skiing events in Sochi the competition took place in the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center. The downhill part was not shortened but held on exactly the same piste as the downhill race two days later. The last three winters saw only seven World Cup Super Combined events organized with only three different winners: Tina Maze (3), Lindsey Vonn (2), and Maria Höfl-Riesch (2), with the Super Combined scheduled for Sochi in 2012 cancelled due to heavy snow. The reigning World champion from 2013 was Höfl-Riesch, while Anna Fenninger won in 2011 with Maze bringing home silver both times. This winter saw only one World Cup Super Combined, which was won by Marie-Michèle Gagnon in Austrian Zauchensee, but with a Super G instead of a downhill, which favors technical skiiers. As Vonn was unable to compete after tearing her right ACL twice in 2013 (the first time at the World Championships in Schladming), the only two big favorites left were Maze and Höfl-Riesch.
Skiing first in the downhill phase Italian Francesca Marsaglia set a time of 1:43.96 and held onto the lead until the seventh skier to start, Lotte Sejersted (NOR), produced a best time of 1:43.85. Lara Gut (SUI), arguably more of a downhill and Super G specialist, then produced a leading time of 1:43.15 to give herself a chance to medal. The only skier to better this time was Julia Mancuso (USA) who skied the course in 1:42.68. Defending champion, Maria Höfl-Riesch (GER), produced a time of 1:43.72 for fifth place and keep her chances of a medal open.
With the top 30 going in reverse order, Šárka Strachová (CZE) was to produce the fastest slalom run of 50.10 seconds, but a 25th place in the downhill section meant she finished ninth overall. Michaela Kirchgasser (AUT), more of a slalom specialist, produced the second quickest slalom for a combined time of 2:36.41, and led as several skiers came in behind her – eventually she would finish seventh. Ragnhild Mowinckel (NOR) and Dominique Gisin (SUI) briefly held the overall lead, until Austrian Nicole Hosp produced a fine run to give her an overall time of 2:35.02. She held onto the lead until Höfl-Riesch produced the third fastest slalom, to take the overall lead with 2:34.62. Gut tried to put in a performance, but was unable to finish the course, so leaving Mancuso the last of the medal contenders. Although only 13th fastest in the slalom, this was enough to give her a combined time of 2:35.15 for the bronze medal.
The first six finishers represented six different nations. As the day before in the men’s downhill, ski manufacturer Head won gold (Höfl-Riesch) and bronze (Mancuso), while Hosp earned silver with Fischer. Höfl-Riesch defended her title and followed in the footsteps of Janica Kostelić who won this event in 2002 and 2006. In total Höfl-Riesch became the sixth Alpine skier (and fourth women) to defend a gold medal.

That year also coincided with the first year that Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was asked to become the USA National coach, a job he continued through the Rio Olympics. Under Krzyzewski, the USA won the 2008 and 2012 Olympic gold medals, and the 2010 and 2014 World Championships, although in 2014 the name changed to World Cup. The only glimmer of hope for the other teams was that several of the USA’s best NBA players, among them LeBron James and Stephen Curry, elected not to play in the Olympics. It mattered little.
In group play the United States won all five of its games to qualify for group play; however, it was not that easy as the USA was challenged in several games. After comfortable wins over China and Venezuela, the US defeated Australia by only 10 points, and then survived very close games against Serbia and France, winning both by three points, and the US appeared vulnerable going into the elimination rounds. Also advancing from Group A were Australia, France and Serbia. In group B, Croatia, Spain, Lithuania, and Argentina finished in an unusual four-way tie with identical 3-2 records, with point differential breaking the tie, but only for seeding purposes.
The quarter-finals saw Australia, France, Serbia, and the United States advancing, as the USA defeated Argentina with ease, 105-78, putting to rest some rumors of their vulnerability. Serbia defeated Croatia in an internecine struggle. The semi-finals were closer for the USA, defeating Spain 82-76, but the game was actually not that tight. The final was a replay of the 2014 World Cup final, with the United States meeting Serbia, who they had only defeated 94-91 in group play, but the game was a romp, with the US winning 95-66, despite easing up in the fourth quarter. The bronze medal match was very close with Spain eking out a victory for the medal, defeating Australia, 89-88. For the winning US team, Carmelo Anthony  became the first man to win three Olympic golds in basketball. The only good news for other nations was that Mike Krzyzewski, who had become the first basketball coach to lead a team to three gold medals, was stepping down as USA National coach, but he would be replaced by Gregg Popovich, considered the top coach in the NBA, from the San Antonio Spurs.

The floor was the only individual event Uchimura qualified for and, as the silver medallist in the floor exercise in London 2012, he was also considered one of the favourites. The Briton Max Whitlock, however, gave an outstanding performance in the all-round event and, as the silver medallist at the 2015 World Championship, he was in with as good a chance as any of the eight men contesting the floor final. Also in contention were the US pair of Sam Mikulak and Jake Dalton, who qualified as the two highest scorers.
First to go was Uchimura but he scored only 15.241 after a couple of errors. He was soon overtaken by Brazil’s Diego Hypólito and he in turn was overtaken by the next man up, Whitlock, who registered 15.633. His fellow Briton Kristian Thomas failed to get amongst the medals but another Brazilian, Arthur Mariano moved into third place with 15.433. The first of the two Americans, Dalton, fell well below his qualifying score and with two gymnasts to go Whitlock was guaranteed at least a bronze medal. Kenzo Shirai was hoping to become the first Japanese gymnast since Sawao Kato in 1968 to win the floor exercise but two bad errors on a routine with the highest difficulty of 7.600 saw him score 15.366 and finish fourth. The only man standing between Whitlock and Britain’s first ever gymnastics gold medal was Sam Mikulak, but his routine resulted in him finishing last with 14.333 and Britain got that elusive gold. For Brazil, their silver and bronze medals added to their country’s solitary medal – a gold won in London 2012 by Arthur Zanetti. For Hypólito, collecting a medal was special as he fell in both the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.

Thus the Olympics and World Championships assumed even greater importance to the female professional riders. For the first time ever at the Olympics, there was no clear favorite in 2004, partly because there were fewer international races. The once dominant Jeannie Longo, rode in her sixth Olympics in 2004, but had not won any major titles in years. The defending champion, Leontien Zijlaard-Van Moorsel of the Netherlands, was back, but nobody could expect her to repeat her 2000 Olympic performance in which she won three events (road race, time trial, individual pursuit) and was silver medalist in the points race. A fall early in the race eliminated her from the competition.

A fall that broke her collarbone just over two months before the Olympics, however, jeopardized her chances of competing in the event, but an accelerated recovery left her as the favorite for the top spot on the podium in 2012. Among her strongest challengers were Germany’s Judith Arndt, the reigning World Champion who had been winning cycling medals since her Olympic individual pursuit bronze in 1996, and the Danish-born Linda Villumsen, competing for New Zealand since 2010, who was the runner-up in the event at the 2011 World Championships. Also notable were Emma Pooley, the 2008 Olympic runner-up and the host nation’s best chance for a medal in the event, and Canadian Clara Hughes, vying to become her country’s most decorated Olympian after having won two cycling bronze medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics before switching to speed skating and earning four Olympic medals at the Winter Olympics between 2002 and 2010, including gold in the 5000m event in 2006. The Dutch cyclist Marianne Vos, who just days before had won the road race and who, in 2008, had won the Olympic points race, could not be ignored either.
In a tough field it was once again the lower-ranked Russian Olga Zabelinskaya who, after surprising spectators with a bronze medal win the road race over the weekend, set an incredibly high bar earlier on by finishing the course with a time of 37:57.35. Pooley, Hughes, and Villumsen all failed to best this mark and, with Vos having been overtaken by Arndt (thus making up the 90 second difference in their starts), Zabelinskaya’s time guaranteed her a medal.

Only one woman, Valentina Vezzali of Italy in the foil, had ever performed this feat in the sport. Zagunis had been World Champion in 2009 and 2010 but had fallen at the final hurdle in 2011 where she was beaten by her Russian nemesis Sofiya Velikaya in the gold medal bout.
Unlike many of the fencing events at London, the sabre played out almost exactly to what had been predicted by the seedings with #5 seed Kim Ji-Yeon of Korea being the only fencer to exceed expectations and reach the semi-final stage at the expense of #4 seed Vasiliki Vougiouka of Greece.
The first semi-final was between Zagunis and Kim and appeared to be going the way of all previous Olympic bouts involving Zagunis when the American sprinted into a 12-5 but the Korean was made of strong material and mounted a ferocious comeback to tie things up at all before winning the final two points of the match and ending Zagunis’s undefeated Olympic run stretching back to the Athens Olympics. The other semi-final went on similar lines but this time the comeback by Olha Kharlan of Ukraine against Velikaya faltered at the last and the Russian held her nerve to register the final decisive pair of hits.
In contrast to the semis, the final was less of a contest as Kim of Korea raced to an early lead and Velikaya was unable to peg back the deficit. The final score 15-9 in favour of the Korean. This was Korea’s first gold in fencing in 12 years and the first ever by a woman. Zagunis was unable to gain consolation from the bronze medal match as she fell 15-10 to Kharlan.

In fact, these three women had occupied the podium at the 1984 Olympics, when Ehrig had beaten Kania and Zange for the title. In the present season, Kania had won the World Cup races in Berlin and Butte, while Ehrig had won in Davos and at the European Championships. Zange had won the World Cup in Calgary, en passant breaking the world record and lowering it to 4:16.76. That record had been in the hands of Yvonne van Gennip, who had skated 4:16.85 in Heerenveen the previous season. But van Gennip had suffered from various injuries in the past months, and had recovered only just in time for the Olympics.
The race started dramatically, with Ehrig racing against Kania. The latter took off at an insane pace. Barely half-way through the race, Kania had a five-second advantage on Zange’s world record. Unsurprisingly, she hit the wall, and barely made it to the finish line, needing almost 40 seconds for the final lap. Ehrig, in the meanwhile, had been able to keep her pace, setting a world record of 4:12.09, well below the old mark. Zange herself, riding in the third pair, approximately matched her own world record (4:16.92), which was enough to beat Kania, but not Ehrig. Van Gennip was behind the leading times for the entire race, but not by far. With her final lap, she made up for the 0.63 second deficit, and crossed the line in 4:11.94, for a very surprising gold medal. It would be the first of her three Olympic titles in Calgary, matching the feat of her compatriot Ard Schenk in 1972.

The trio of main protagonists were reigning champion Ellen Preis of Austria, 1928 victor Helene Mayer of Germany and European champion Ilona Elek of Hungary. All three were Jewish.
Helene Mayer was the daughter of a Jewish father and a Protestant mother and although she did not implicitly think of herself as being Jewish, this was not enough to shield herself from persecution in Germany after Hitler’s rise to power. With a growing threat by a number of nations to boycott the Games in protest at the actions of the National Socialist government in Germany, it was considered prudent for the German team to include a Jewish athlete in their Olympic team. Mayer, by now resident in California, was invited back home to compete for Germany in Berlin.
The final pool was a close affair. Ilek lost to the second ranked German Hedwig Haß but defeated both Mayer and Preis to post a 6-1 record which was enough to clinch the gold medal.  Mayer’s superior record of hits made against hits conceded earned her second place ahead of Preis amongst those with 5 wins with Haß missing out on a chance of gold after an unexpected loss to 7th place finisher Ilona Vargha.
Ilek defended her title in 1948 and, at age 45, won the silver medal in 1952. Preis also returned to the Olympic arena for a further three appearances. Mayer, who was eventually stripped of her German citizenship, settled permanently in California before the outbreak of war but later returned to Germany where she died of cancer in 1952.

Expected to challenge the East Europeans was Paul Hildgartner, the Italian who had taken the 1978 world title, and had been a doubles Olympic champion back in Sapporo.
After two days, the leader was, as expected, Günther with two wins. Rinn had been eliminated for a medal position after an error in curve 12, which would come to play a decisive role in the competition. Behind Günther, the Italian Ernst Haspinger (who would win the season’s World Cup) and compatriot Bernhard Glass (bronze at the 1979 European Championships) took places 2 and 3. In the third run, Günther was heading for another win when he fell over coming out of turn 12. He managed to get back on the sled and finish, but had tumbled back to 9th in the overall standings. With one descent to go, this left Ernst Haspinger in pole position for the Olympic gold. His main challenger, Glass, set the first time in the last run, 43.482. Haspinger had almost half a second on Glass – a large margin in luge terms – and seemed headed for the gold until 150 metres before the finish. Once more, turn 12 took a victim, and Haspinger finished last in the run and fell off the podium. Glass thus became the surprising winner, ahead of Hildgartner and Anton Winkler (FRG).

Her biggest challenger was expected to be Jamaican Stephenie McPherson. A sentimental choice was American Allyson Felix, by then 35-years-old. She had been among the world’s top 200 / 400 runners since 2005 and had 13 World Championship gold medals and six Olympic golds, but coming back from motherhood in 2018, her times were far from her best, and she was considered a longshot for a medal.
The semi-finals had few surprises as Miller-Uibo won the second easily, and McPherson won the third, with Dominican runner Marileidy Paulino winning the first semi-final in a national record 49.38. Felix also qualified, advancing behind McPherson in the third semi with a season best mark of 49.89.
In the final, McPherson took the lead on the first turn out of lane six. At 200 metres she led in 23.4 alongside Britain’s Jodie Williams, with Miller-Uibo and Felix a tenth behind. At that point SMU turned it on and was well ahead entering the final straight, 0.3 ahead of Felix, with McPherson and Paulino 0.6 back.
Miller-Uibo finished in 48.36 to win gold, setting a new North American record. Behind her Paulino was the strongest of the challengers, finishing in 49.20 for silver. Felix shocked all the experts by maintaining her speed to finish in 49.46, her second fastest time ever, to win the bronze medal.
Miller-Uibo became the second woman to defend Olympic gold in the 400 metres, after France’s Marie-José Pérec in 1992-96. Felix’s bronze was her 10th Olympic medal, the most ever by a woman, breaking her tie with Merlene Ottey. A few days later she would help the USA win gold in the 4x400 to finish her Olympic career with 11 medals and 7 gold medals.

The final was very close, but Taylor made it three wins in a row over Yazdani, defeating him on points, 4-3. Nayfonov won his repêchage final to secure a bronze medal, but Punia was defeated by Sammarinese Myles Nazem Amine for the other bronze.

Ironically, the largest man to set foot in the Olympic ring may well have been one of the referees, Captain Mabbutt of the USA. The crowd was often heard shouting “Sit down!” when he was obstructing their view of the fighting.
Alberto Lovell of Argentina, considered by his countrymen as a “new Jack Dempsey”, defeated future European amateur champion Gunnar Bärlund of Finland in the opening round then demolished the unfortunate Canadian George Maughan to reach the final. The California native, Fred Feary, lost to Italian southpaw Luigi Rovati in the other semi-final. The Argentine favoured power over finesse but his performance was enough to edge his way to a points victory and take the gold medal and become the first black Olympic heavyweight champion.
If Lovell expected a hero’s welcome back in Buenos Aires, it certainly did not happen. An argument over the standard of food provided on the boat journey home led to Lovell punching one of the ship’s officers, this led to a near-riot involving other members of the Argentine Olympic squad. Singled out as a ringleader, Lovell was kept in custody for the rest of the voyage. Rather than being greeted with a ticker-tape reception he was instead escorted to the nearest police station.
Although Lovell was knocked out in his professional début, he went on to have a long and successful career. Holder of the Argentine heavyweight title for fifteen years, he was also South American champion and only lost eight of his eighty-eight fights. His second knockout defeat came in his last fight, at the hands of the great American stylist, Archie Moore. Lovell came from a family of heavyweight boxers, his brother Guillermo was the silver medallist four years later in Berlin. His son Santiago boxed in Tokyo and went on to box professionally with some success and another son, Pedro, was also a professional fighter and played the part of “Spider Rico” in the first and last “Rocky” movies.

If so, the maximum length of the foil blade was 34 inches (86 cm). The target area was the body “within the limits bounded by the collar of the fencing jacket, the median line, the hip, and a line drawn from the hip to the posterior limit of the armpit, around the front of the arm and along the crest of the shoulder to the collar”. The “median line” referred to a vertical line running down the middle of the front of the torso which meant that touches were valid only to the half of the torso on the side of the fencing arm. Touches to the other side of the torso were not valid. Touches to the back were also not valid.
As was common in Europe, the winner of a foil bout was not determined by the number of touches scored but rather based on the evaluation by the judges. They would have been using a head judge and either two or four side judges for each of the bouts. The fencers bouted for four minutes of actual fencing time, switching sides after two. At the end of the bout: “Each judge without consulting his fellow judges shall award 100 points or any part thereof to each contestant at the end of the bout. The score shall be the average of the sum of the points obtained. The award of each judge shall be announced at the end of each bout.” The fencer whose average score was the highest was the winner of the bout. So, no touch counts are shown in the results because they were not used to determine the winners.
This had the largest field of any 1904 fencing event with nine competitors, which required two preliminary pools to advance four fencers to the final round. There were also fencers from four nations – Cuba, Germany, Great Britain, and the United States. Cuba’s Ramón Fonst went undefeated, winning all four of his pool matches and all three bouts in the final, to win the gold medal. Fonst also won gold in St. Louis with the épée, and had won that weapon at the 1900 Olympics in Paris, and in team foil in 1904. Albertson Van Zo Post won the silver medal, one of five fencing medals he won in St. Louis. He would also compete again at the 1912 Olympics for the United States, but won no medals in Stockholm.

After seven racers Weirather was in the lead, just 0.01 seconds ahead of Gut, who was also only another 0.03 seconds ahead of Schnarf. The changing winds meant that not all skiers had the same conditions, but with bib #15 Veith took the lead, 1/10th of a second faster than Weirather. It looked like a fairytale that Veith could win gold after missing almost two seasons due to a multiple ligament right knee injury in October 2015 and another surgery in her left knee due to a chronic inflammation in February 2017.
Ester Ledecká in bib #26, however, ended this dream and a new fairytale started. Ledecká, whose best World Cup Super G result ever at this point was twice 19th, was only 0.01 seconds faster than Veith to win the most surprising Alpine skiing gold at this Games. Her winning speed was 89.21 km/h and at the end Ledecká was only 25 cm. ahead of Veith.
Ledecká, who was already a double snowboarding World Champion, went on to also win gold in the snowboarding parallel giant slalom seven days later to win a unique and unusual double at the Olympics, becoming the first ever woman (summer and winter) to win two gold medals in two different sports at the same Olympics. She was also the first ever Alpine skiing Olympic champion from the Czech Republic, breaking the Austrian domination in this event, who had won the last three titles.
The bronze medal won by Weirather was the first ever Super G medal for Liechtenstein and the first Olympic medal (summer and winter) for this country since Paul Frommelt won bronze in slalom back in 1988. For her win Ledecká used Atomic skis loaned to her by Mikaela Shiffrin, who did not participate in this race, while Veith and Weirather skied Head. Ledecká also created the most comical press moment at these Games, when she appeared at the press conference wearing her ski goggles. She later explained that she never expected to win a medal and so she was not made up.

Sumegi posted the fastest time in the opening round, defeating Dîba and helping to relegate Sztanity to the repêchage in the process, while Parfenovich bested Śledziewski in his own heat. A third heat was won by Frank-Peter Bischof, who was representing East Germany, the most recent World bronze medalist. Bischof again won an easy heat in the semi-finals, while Sumegi helped eliminate Śledziewski in a different one. The final heat was shared by Parfenovich, Dîba, and Sztanity, who finished in that order. In the medal round, the competitors began distancing themselves from one another in the final stretch and Parfenovich, Sumegi, and Dîba completed the course in that order without too much trouble. Dîba also took silver in the K-4 1000 at these Games, while Parfenovich became a triple Olympic champion thanks to his performance in the K-2 500, the K-2 1000, and this event.

Ties were broken by the most number of hits, and then the most of hits in the black portion of the target, although this is not recorded to allow to be certain of breaking all the tied positions.
For the first and only time, the World Championships were held concurrently with the Olympics and the Olympic Champions also became World Champions. It was the fourth staging of the World Championships, having previously been held in Lyon (France) in 1897, Turin (Italy) 1898 and Loosduinen 1899 which, since 1923 has been a district of Den Haag (Netherlands).
In the three previous championships, the nine medals in this event had been won by nine different shooters, of whom seven were competing in Paris, including the 1898 and 1899 world champions Achille Paroche (France) and Lars Jørgen Madsen (Denmark). Also competing in Paris were Ole Østmo (Norway), the silver medallist from 1897, Léon Moreaux (France) and Konrad Stäheli (Switzerland), the 1898 silver and bronze medallists, and the silver and bronze winners from 1899, Emil Kellenberger and Franz Böckli (both from Switzerland).
However, it was the 1899 World Championships silver medallist Kellenberger who won the gold medal with the best performance in the kneeling phase, and tied with second-placed Anders Peter Nielsen, followed by steady performances in the prone and standing elements. Nielsen lost the gold medal because of his weaker effort standing. The results in Paris were relatively poor. Kellenberger’s final score of 930 was the lowest ever to win a gold medal in this event at the World Championships (1897 cannot be compared) and would have only brought him just a bronze in 1898 and 1899. Only the results at the 1908 Olympics eventually produced poorer scores.

The Germans had developed an outstanding pair in Maxi Herber/Ernst Baier. Baier was a former single skater, coming 5th in the 1932 Olympics. He started training for pairs skating with Maxi in November 1932 when she was 12, and they was able to win a bronze medal in the 1934 World Championships, only 15 months later.

Three weeks before the Olympics 1936, they really impressed by winning a unanimous victory at the European Championships in Berlin, still without the presence of Rotter/Szollás. The excellent figure skating milieu in Vienna had been able to produce a really outstanding young pair in the siblings Ilse and Erik Pausin. At their first international championships, the World in 1935, they came second after Rotter/Szollás, she aged 16 and he only 14. They did not show up for the Europeans in Berlin, but reports from Vienna told that they were making great progress in training.
Emilia Rotter and László Szollás, both Jewish, hoped to crown their career with an Olympic victory in Garmisch.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Ilse was still only 20 and Erik 19, but they ended their career with eight silver medals from international championships as their only championships medals. Maxi Herber and Ernst Baier revolutionized pair skating by being the first to perform side by side jumps in competition. They married in 1941 and had three children.

She came to the Mexico City Olympics as the favorite, having won the 1966 World Championships, although Soviet Nataliya Kuchinskaya was close at the 1966 Worlds in Dortmund, Germany. In Mexico City, it was not close, as Čáslavská won easily over Kuchinskaya’s teammate, Zinaida Voronina, the wife of Mikhail Voronin, who was also second in the men’s all-around in 1968. Kuchinskaya won the bronze medal. To top things off for her, at the end of the 1968 Olympics, Čáslavská got married after the competition ended, marrying Josef Odložil, who won a silver medal in Mexico in the 1,500 metre run.
However, Čáslavská almost did not compete at the 1968 Olympics. In April 1968 she had signed the “Manifesto of 2000 Words,” which opposed Soviet involvement in Czechoslovakia. In August 1968, the Soviet Union invaded Prague to put down Czechoslovak protests. Čáslavská was warned she could be arrested and fled to the mountains, where she trained on her own in the fields and forests. She was eventually allowed to compete at the Olympics, but the Soviets did not forget. She never was able to obtain a coaching job in Czechoslovakia, and remained unemployed. She was told to renounce her support of the manifesto, but continually refused. She later coached the Mexican team from 1979-81 but on her return to Czechoslovakia, the restrictions on her were kept in place. After the fall of the Eastern Bloc in 1989, Čáslavská’s brave support of her principles became an asset, and she eventually became President of the Czech Olympic Committee and a member of the IOC.
Life was not much better for Zinaida Voronina, though for far less noble reasons. She and her husband won 10 gymnastics medals in Mexico City, but Zinaida later turned to alcohol abuse, her husband divorced her, she lost custody of her son, and she was only able to obtain work as a manual laborer, a job she also lost because of her alcoholism.

Rutschow-Stomporowski had retired, however, which transformed the event into a constant battle between Neykova and Karsten, one that would continue into the 2008 Summer Olympics.

The semi-finals were even more exciting, as Karsten and Neykova faced off, with the latter winning by 0.43 seconds and both helping to eliminate Twigg. It was Zhang, however, who had the fastest time in this round, with Guerette and Knapková rounding out the three qualifiers and leaving Bascelli behind. The final was an enthralling race in which the places changed many times, but the dash for the finish line came down to a battle between Guerette and Neykova, the latter of whom was able to eke out a victory by 0.44 seconds, leaving the American with silver. Karsten, perhaps paying the price for her efforts in the semi-finals, lost to Neykova and settled for a bronze medal. Both competitors, however, now had a full set of Olympic medals in the single sculls, although Karsten had two Olympic titles and a bronze medal from the 1992 quadruple sculls as well.

His challengers were felt to be the Canadian Doug Rogers, who had trained with Inokuma in Japan, and the Soviet Georgian, Anzor K’ik’nadze, who had almost defeated Inokuma in 1961, using sambo armlock techniques. There were five pools. Inokuma, Rogers, and K’ik’nadze all won their pools comfortably, as did Kim Jong-Dai of Korea. Inokuma and Kim faced off in the only knock-out (quarter-final) match. Inokuma put Kim to the mat and held him down until Kim tapped submission, which was almost unheard of in that era. Rogers faced the second Soviet, Parnaoz Chik’viladze, in the first semi-final, with Rogers winning with yusei-gachi. In the second semi-final, Inokuma remembered his near defeat to K’ik’nadze and took no chances of allowing him to get his armlock hold. He threw K’ik’nadze with tai-otoshi at the five-minute mark and won the match to advance to the final against Rogers. The final was a dull affair, with little wrestling occurring for the first 10 minutes. The referee, Charles Palmer (GBR), warned both judoka, and threatened to disqualify both with neither getting a medal. The pace quickened a little, but not much. Inokuma was given the decision for greater aggressiveness although the result was formally termed kinsa.

The boats are a two-person, one-design heavyweight monohull dinghy. Its design was started in The Netherlands, but it was designed somewhat by committee as, after its preliminary design was finished in September 1951, it was sent to 30 European sailors, and there were 23 responses with subsequent modifications to the design.
The Flying Dutchman boats raced on the Giallo Course, as did the Star Class. Norway’s Peder Lunde, Jr. built up such a big lead after six races that he placed 10th in the final race, and still won the gold medal by almost 800 points over Denmark’s Hans Fogh. Fogh would compete in six Olympics, from 1960-72 for Denmark and in 1976 and 1984 for Canada, adding a bronze medal in 1984 in the Soling Class while representing Canada.
Lunde, making his Olympic début, was only 18-years-old, but would compete in four Olympics, also winning a silver medal in the Star Class in 1968. His family is one of the renowned in Olympic sailing history. His grandfather, Eugen Lunde, won a gold medal in the 1924 6-metre class, and his father and mother, Peder and Vibeke, won silver medals in the 1952 5.5 metre class. Peder, Jr.’s daughter, Jeannette, competed in Alpine skiing at the 1994 and 2000 Winter Olympics. His wife and sister-in-law also competed in Alpine skiing for Norway at the Olympics.

Only in the semi-final did either of the duo suffer the risk of elimination. Denis Dmitriyev of Russia took race one of the semi-final against Kenny, becoming the first non-British rider to win a heat against a British rider since 2004, but Kenny recovered to win in three races.
The final was an anti-climax as Kenny’s superior track craft proved too much for his less experienced opponent and he won with a heat to spare. Dmitriyev’s match against Australian Matthew Glaetzer was equally as one sided in the Russian’s favour. Kenny became only the third man to retain an Olympic title in this event after Daniel Morelon and Jens Fiedler.

The long-range favourite, 2016 bantamweight champion Robeisy Ramírez, defected to the USA in summer 2018 to pursue a professional career. Although this did not necessarily rule him of out of Tokyo, the enmity it earned from the Cuban government meant his Olympic career was ended.

Dewinter’s fight with  Andy Scrivani of the USA was costly for the American,  a number of cuts were opened up above his eyes and the resultant damage was blamed for impeding him in his quarter-final loss against the Swede, Erik Ågren. Ågren impressed those at ringside with his skilful performance against the courageous American, was briefly considered a possible champion but then lost his next fight to Stepulov of Estonia.
José Padilla’s medal hopes were ended by Imre Harangi of Hungary in the last eight and the Hungarian continued his run to the final by defeating Kops of Denmark. Estonia had never entered a boxing team before but Nikolai Stepulov won the vote of the judges in his first four contests and found himself in the final against Harangi.
The Estonian started strongly in the final and observers judged him to have taken the first round with a crisp display of punching. By this time Harangi had began bleeding over both eyes, one cut was measured at nearly four centimetres, and his vision was becoming impaired. Despite his injuries the Hungarian fought back and from the second round onwards took the upper hand. An appreciative crowd cheered him as he edged ahead and took the verdict.
Stepulov and Ågren went on to win medals at the 1937 European championships. In the professional ranks. Simon Dewinter, who fought and lost a European title match, was most successful.

Their final Olympic meeting in Sydney was considered by some as one of the highlights of the Games.
By the time of Athina both horses had long retired and Werth was not even on the German team. Van Grunsven travelled as part of the Dutch team albeit with low expectations following a series of personal setbacks and the mantle of favorite had passed to Sydney bronze medallist Ulla Salzgeber of Germany. Van Grunsven, Sweden’s Jan Brink, Beatriz Ferrer-Salat of Spain and the rest of the German team were expected to challenge.
With the elimination on medical grounds of one of the Greek horses and the withdrawal of a Swiss entrant there were 51 starters for the first phase of the event. These first two days of competition doubled as both the team event and the first round of the individual event, the top 25 riders moving into the second phase of competition although no more than three riders from each country could progress. Salzgeber’s test put her in a clear lead of over 3.5 points, the difference between the leader and second being more than the difference between second and twelfth place. Ferrar-Salat and Van Grunsven occupied second and third with Schaudt of Germany and Debbie McDonald of America on their heels.
If Salzgeber had been outstanding in the first stage of the event it was the turn of Van Grunsven and her horse Salinero to excel in the second phase, the Grand Prix Special Test. Van Grunsven’s score of 77.80 was nearly three whole points clear of Salzgeber although the German maintained a small overall lead of half a point. Another solid performance from Ferrar-Salat put her in third place ahead of McDonald. Relatively disappointing displays by Brink and Schaudt suggested that the first four riders would contest the medals.
In the deciding kür segment (freestyle to music) van Grunsven entered the arena before Salzgeber. Performing to a piece entitled “Esprit Chanson (The Spirit of the Song)” by the Dutch composers Cees Slings and Viktor Kerkhof, Salinero barely made an error and received a number of perfect tens from the judges. A superb score of 85.525 meant that Salzgeber would have to perform at the highest level to secure the championship. Salzgeber’s final score of 83.450 had only been beaten by Van Grunsven in Olympic kür tests but was not enough to deny the Dutchwoman successive Olympic championships. She became only the third rider to retain the individual title and the first to win individual medals in three successive games. Beatriz Ferrer-Salat’s bronze medal was Spain’s first individual medal in Olympic dressage.
At the time of the Athina Games van Grunsven was over five months pregnant, and her first son Yannick was born on 23 November 2004.

Lindblad lost his second round match to Gurics and then was eliminated after round three on bad points, despite defeating Hodge. Tsimak’uridze had defeatd Gurics in round five so when he defeated Takhti in the final round, the gold medal was his. Takhti then defeated Gurics for the silver medal.
Takhti would have a distinguished Olympic career, which began in Helsinki. In 1956 he won freestyle gold as a light-heavyweight, and he added another silver medal in 1960 in light-heavyweight freestyle. He also competed at the 1964 Olympics, just missing the podium in fourth. Takhti was considered Iran’s greatest sporting hero of the 20th century, but he was politically active against the Iranian government under the Shah of Iran. He died in January 1968, with his death ruled by the state as a suicide, but many rumors persist that he was murdered because of activities against the government.

The tiebreaker for the Short Program was the Required Elements score, while the tiebreaker for the Free Skating was the Artistic Impression score.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall for that section.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The tiebreakers were then 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  The placement for the Compulsory Figures was factored by 0.6 (30%), the placement for the short program was factored by 0.4 (20%), and the placement for Free Skating was factored by 1.0 (50%).

Witt, who had been 1983 and 1984 European Champion, then won the short program, while Sumners placed only fifth, falling to second overall. The gold medal would come down to whichever of them could win the free skate. The free skate was very close. Sumners looked to have the better of it for most of her routine. But near the end she doubled a planned triple toe loop and singled a double axel. Witt was voted first in the free skate by five judges to four for Sumners, giving Witt the gold medal. Witt would return in 1988 to win a second gold medal. Her beauty and skating artistry and athleticism would eventually make her a very wealthy woman. She was the first East German athlete who was allowed to skate professionally and after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1991, she made millions.

In the lead was a 22-year-old skier from Finland, Senja Pusula, 3.1 seconds ahead of another first time Olympian, Sweden’s Toini Gustafsson. But it was very close.

Pusula faded in the last part of the race and dropped down to ninth place at the finish, but her teammate Lehtonen was the big surprise of the day.

A tall, attractive blond, the former East German seemed about to capitalize on her fame with endorsements not previously available to her. But early in 1992 she and some of her teammates went to train in South Africa. There were accusations that this was done to avoid drug testing and the Germans responded by sending a testing team down there. All of the women tested negative but then it was revealed that all of the urine samples had come from the same person. They were all suspended for four years by the German Track Federation, but after appeals to the IAAF this was revoked. However, in June Krabbe withdrew from the Olympics, because of the stress she had been through in the past few months. In July she did test positive, this time for clenbuterol, and she never competed again.
With Krabbe out, the favorite’s role fell to Jamaica’s Merlene Ottey who had had been bronze medalist in 1980 and placed fourth in 1984. She had won medals at all three World Championships, though never a gold, and was 1990 Commonwealth Champion. Her biggest challenge was expected to come from American Gwen Torrence. Torrence was considered a possibility to win the 100/200 but a few days earlier had finished fourth in the 100. She then claimed that )Two of the three medalists are not clean. I’m sick and tired of it.) The 100 medalists had been Gail Devers (USA/gold), Juliet Cuthbert (JAM/silver), and Irina Privalova (EUN/bronze). Torrence never said who the two were, and a few days later she retracted her statement but it added to the controversy of the 200. In the final Torrence, Privalova, Cuthbert and Ottey were drawn in the middle of the track.

Petersen wrote mostly about ancient and medieval motifs and was well recognized for his knowledge of ancient cultures, but not from the contemporary literary criticism. He won all his Olympic art medals (1924, 1932 and 1948) with works on ancient Greek sports motifs, in 1924 for Euryale.

As a professional, he would win the World Championships in the individual pursuit in 1963, 1965, and 1966, and also won gold in Melbourne in the kilometer.

Great Britain won the bronze medal, their sixth consecutive bronze in team pursuit, a streak that would end in 1960 when they did not make the quarter-finals. Britain’s best known rider was Tom Simpson, later a top professional who was World Champion on the road in 1965, and during his career won the Ronde de Vlaanderen, Paris-Bordeaux, Milan-San Remo, the Giro di Lombardia, and Paris-Nice.

Kardanov had been World Cup Champion in 1992 and 1995 and was the 1998 European Champion, but his gold medal came from the blue. Lindland was also not well known, but would win a silver medal at the 2001 World Championships and then turned to mixed martial arts, competing with multiple groups in that fighting sport in the United States. Yli-Hannuksela would improve to a silver medal in this class at the 2004 Olympics.

The 6 metre boats are usually 10 to 11 metres long. The formula uses the values of boat length, beam, waterline length, skin girth and chain girth, freeboard and sail area. The result is a fixed number, which is then referred to as the ship class. The class identifier for the 6 m class was an underlined Six “6”.
Three 6 metre boats competed in six races at the 1932 Olympics, so all teams won a medal. There was not much drama in this event as the standings were the same in all six races. The Swedish yacht Bissbi, skippered by Tore Holm, dominated the regatta, winning all the races and the gold medal.

But at the IC4A title in Philadelphia on 1 June 1912, Yale’s Robert Gardner won, clearing 3.985 (13-1), the first 13-foot vault.  The mark lasted only a week, as Marc Wright won the eastern Olympic Trial with the first four-metre vault, clearing 13-2¼ (4.02).
Of the above mentioned American vaulters, all but Cook, Gilbert, Paulding, and Gardner competed at Stockholm, giving the United States six top vaulters from which to choose.  Among other nations, the Swedes championed Bertil Uggla, while Canada sent William Halpenny, who had been United States’ AAU champion in 1908 and would win the Canadian championship in 1911-1913.
The final six vaulters came down to Uggla, Halpenny, and four Americans - Babcock, Nelson, Wright and Murphy.  At 3.85 metres, Halpenny had to withdraw, having broken two ribs in clearing 3.80.  He was joined by Uggla and Murphy who failed to clear 3.85.  At 3.85, Harold Babcock cleared on his first attempt, while Nelson and Wright needed two efforts.  But when the bar was raised to 3.95, only Babcock was successful, again on one attempt.  He took three shots at a new world record of 4.06 (13-3¾) but failed.

On the eighth lap of the race, Longo got away with Italy’s Imelda Chiappa and Clara Hughes (CAN) and Anna Wilson (AUS). In the pouring rain, Wilson was dropped quickly, but the other three stayed away. Early on the final lap, Longo powered away from Chiappa and Hughes and rode to her much deserved gold medal. Hughes returned to the Olympics in 2000 in cycling and in 2002 and 2006, competed at the Winter Olympics in speed skating.

Averina was the top female skater at the 1976 Winter Olympics. She won two gold medals and two bronze medals in the four events.

But the Norwegians weren’t the only favorites, with Sweden fielding World Record holder Åke Seyffarth and Göthe Hedlund, and Finland entering 1947 World Champion Lassi Parkkinen, who also won 5,000 at that occasion.
Weather conditions were far less favorable than a day earlier. Throughout the 20-pair competition the wind changed regularly, accompanied varyingly by snow and sun. The race, originally set for a 1030 start was rescheduled to 0845, a change that was not announced to all spectators. The first surprise of the race was the fall of 1936 1,500 m champion Charles Mathiesen, who was out of shape and retired. After Dutchmen Jan Langedijk and Kees Broekman both went below 8.40, Hedlund went off for a very fast start. He slowed considerably during the last laps, but lowered the top mark to 8.34,8.
The most interesting pair of the competition was that between Lundberg and Harry Jansson (Sweden). Like Hedlund, Jansson went off quick, with Lundberg trailing for most of the race. At three laps, the Norwegian took command and also built up a lead on Hedlund, finishing after 8.32,7. Jansson, who had been slower than Hedlund for the entire race came very close to beating his compatriot, finished quickly and missed out by only one tenth of a second. In the 14th pair, Seyffarth was hoped to join his compatriots in the top-3, but he failed. This was partially due to a brush with a photographer, who had stepped onto the ice. In the next heat, Reidar Liaklev skated a very steady race. Lapping his Swiss opponent Heinz Hugelshofer, he improved on Lundberg’s mark with 8.29,4. The only contender left was Lassi Parkkinen, but his chances were ruined by heavy snowfall start right after Liaklev’s pair.

Between then and the 1964 Olympics, the world record was bettered 15 times. Improvement was so rapid that many marks never received IAAF approval, as they were quickly superseded by a better mark. The best jumpers in 1962-63 were John Pennel and Brian Sternberg. Sternberg broke the world record three times, the last on 7 June 1963. He was a superb athlete, also one of the best in the United States on the trampoline. On 28 June 1963 he was practicing on the trampoline doing a double-back with a full twist, a simple maneuver for him. But he landed badly, breaking his neck and was rendered quadriplegic. He would never vault, or walk again, though he lived until May 2013.
With Sternberg out, the favorites for Tokyo were Pennel and a vaulter who came on in 1964, Fred Hansen. Hansen set three world records in June-July 1964. He was AAU Champion in 1964 and won the Olympic Trials. Pennel injured his back shortly before the Olympics and would finish only 11th. In the final the competition came down to Hansen and three Germans, Wolfgang Reinhardt, Klaus Lehnertz (both FRG), and Manfred Preußger (GDR). All four cleared five metres on their first attempts. Hansen passed 5.05, while Reinhardt went over on his first try, with Lehnertz and Preußger failing at that height. Thus the gold medal was Reinhardt’s unless Hansen could outjump him at 5.10 (16-8¾).

For the first two rounds the final was closely contested with the Cuban possibly holding the advantage but at the start of the third, a cut above Demyanenko’s eye worsened and the fight was stopped by the ringside doctor.

One other change was that long-time Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who had coached the United States’ team at the last three Olympics, had stepped down, with the NBA’s San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich now in charge. It was likely a minor change as Popovich was one of the greatest coaches in NBA annals.
Once in Tokyo, France defeated the United States in the first group match, 83-76, further inflaming their critics. France went on to win Group A, while the USA finished second but still advanced to the knockout rounds. The other groups were won by Australia and Slovenia, which was led by 2019 NBA Rookie of the Year Luka Dončić, who scored 48 points again Argentina in their group match-up.
Sparked by Kevin Durant, who would win his third gold medal, the USA won their quarter-final over Spain, 95-81 and then beat Australia quite comfortably in the semi-finals, seemingly getting stronger with each game. In the other half of the bracket, France defeated Italy and then Slovenia to earn a re-match with the Americans. The final was relatively close, but the United States was in charge the entire second half and finally won gold by 87-82. Australia defeated Slovenia, 107-93, to take the bronze medal, giving the Aussies their first Olympic medal in men’s basketball after four fourth-place finishes (1988, 1996, 2000, 2016).

In addition, both finalists won the first ever Olympic fencing medal for their country.
Eventual champion was Venezuela’s Rubén Limardo, winning only his country’s second ever Olympic title. En route to the final, he ousted the world number 5 (Max Heinzer) and the current World Champion (Paolo Pizzo). His semi-final opponent, Seth Kelsey had won World Championship medals with the US team, and had kicked out Nikolai Novosjolov, the number one seed. Limardo’s opponent in the final was Norway’s Bartosz Piasecki. The son of a Polish fencing coach, he had defeated two members of the 2011 French World Championship team - including a narrow 15-14 defeat of Yannick Borel - as well as veteran Géza Imre of Hungary.
The final saw Limardo gaining a clear 14-6 lead, before he almost succumbed to pressure, allowing Piasecki to comeback to 14-10, before finishing off the match. The bronze medal match gave more excitement: Jeong Jin-Seon defeated Kelsey only in over-time, after two double-hits (the fencers touching each other simultaneously).

Aikido was developed by Morihei Ueshiba to synthesize martial arts, philosophy, and religious beliefs. Aikido may be translated as “the Way of unifying (with) life energy” or as “the Way of harmonious spirit.” Sixteen (16) different shiai events were demonstrated at Tokyo in 1964 as part of the kendo demonstrations.

Pearce’s position was only strengthened when Germany’s Herbert Buhtz, the winner of the 1932 Diamond Sculls, fell ill and was unable to compete (he did, however, win a silver medal in the double sculls, alongside Gerhard Boetzelen). In both the opening round and the final, the only rower who was able to challenge him was Bill Miller of the United States, a silver medalist in the coxed fours from the 1928 Games. Miller was able to hold his own in both races and trounced his opponents in the repêchage. Pearce was simply the superior sculler, however, and successfully defended his crown with a time of 7:44.4. Miller, less than a second behind, took silver while Guillermo Douglas of Uruguay, despite finishing over 28 seconds after Miller, came in third and won his nation’s first individual Olympic medal  (the country had won the 1924 and 1928 football tournaments).

The first round showed some excellent jumping. Kankkonen made the longest jump of the day, 95.5 m and had a 4.2 points lead over Engan, who did 93.5 m. Dieter Neuendorf was third, only 0.7 points ahead of the bronze medal winner from the Normal Hill, Torgeir Brandtzæg.
In the second round, with reduced runway length, Engan again made a stylish jump at 90.5 m. Kankkonen equalled Engan’s distance, but was penalized for a bad landing and was 1.8 points behind Engan. Brandtzæg advanced into bronze medal position after a 90 m jump, and was almost ten points ahead of the rest of the field. Engan, Kankkonen and Brandtzæg were all in a position to take the gold medal.
In the third round, the speed was again reduced. Brandtzæg, jumping first of the favorites, improved with another good jump at 87 m, but could not catch Engan and Kankkonen in the total points and had to settle for his second bronze medal. Engan, seemingly nervous, made a total miss at 73 m, but was still in the lead. Kankkonen had to make an 87-88 m jump with decent style points to pass Engan in the fight for the gold medal. The Finn made another excellent jump at 88 m, and seemed to have full control, but just after the landing he lost his balance and touched the snow with one of his hands. The jump was judged as a fall, and Engan had his revenge.
Engan was Norway’s first Olympic ski jumping champion in 12 years, and the Norwegians were back again as a major force in ski jumping. However, both Engan and Brandtzæg had short careers after their 1964 Olympic success. Later in 1964, during training two days before the Holmenkollen competition, Brandtzæg had a bad fall, while jumping 10 m longer than the hill record, and was severely injured. This fearless jumper tried a comeback the year after, but in spite of winning the national Large Hill Championships he felt he was not able to regain his former strength, and therefore decided to quit at the age of 23. After his great 1964- season Engan had two rather disappointing seasons. He was on the Norwegian 1966 World Championship team, and ended his career by coming 10th in the Large Hill Competition at the World Championships in Holmenkollen.

Rhode hit 74 of 75 targets in qualifying and then had a perfect 25 in the final round to win her third gold medal and fifth shooting medal in all. Her other golds came in double trap in 1996 and 2004. The bronze medal came down to a shoot-off between Slovakian Danka Barteková and Russian Marina Belikova with Barteková winning bronze on her fourth target.
Rhode set several Olympic records and bests with this gold medal. Her percentage of victory margin was the most dominant Olympic victory in an individual shooting event – with Rhode’s score being 108.8% of Wei’s. The next most dominant victory occurred in 2004 men’s double trap when Ahmed Al-Maktoum (UAE) defeated Rajyavardhan Rathore (IND), 189-179, a percentage victory margin of 105.6%.
Her five medals equals the most ever in Olympic shooting by a woman, set by Marina Dobrancheva-Logvinenko (RUS), Mariya Grozdeva (BUL), and Jasna Šekarić (YUG/SCG/SRB). Overall she is tied for second among Olympic shooting in terms of medals won, also tied with Germany’s Ralf Schumann, all trailing China’s Wang Yifu who has six. Rhode became the first woman to win three gold medals in Olympic shooting.
Rhode became the fifth person in any Olympic sport to win an individual medal at five consecutive Olympic Games or Winter Games, although she was only the second athlete to do so at the Summer Games, joining Japan’s judoka Ryoko Tamura-Tani, and Winter Olympians Armin Zöggeler (ITA-LUG), Georg Hackl (GER-LUG), and Claudia Pechstein (GER-SSK). Nobody has done this at six straight Olympics.
Finally, with this victory Rhode won gold medals over a gap of 16 years (1996-2012), a new Olympic best for women, and second all-time in all Olympic sports only to Belgium’s Hubert Van Innis, who won archery individual gold medals in 1900 and 1920.

Two of their entrants, among them their favorite Sven Utterström, were ill and were replaced before the start, so the Swedish contingent had no big expectations.
The morning start was held in mild weather conditions, but the forecast predicted colder weather during the day. However, this turned out to be completely wrong. One hour after the start the temperature changed completely, with the famous föhn wind coming from the south with the result that the temperature rose to 25° C. (77° F.) in the sun.

The Norwegian Ole Hegge was in front in the first stage of the race, but at 15 km. Per-Erik Hedlund, a strong lumberjack from Särna, equaled Hegge’s intermediate time, and from then on the Swedes, apparently having done a better job with their skis, totally dominated the race. Hedlund, who was not able to finish the 50 km. in Chamonix four years earlier, opened up a substantial lead, at the 35 km. mark he was almost eight minutes ahead of his fellow countryman Gustaf Jonsson, followed by substitute Volger Andersson another 1:30 behind the leader. Hedlund took his time to stop and prepare his skis, certainly a wise decision, since he was then able to expand his lead substantially. The Norwegians and Finns were really struggling, Hegge was already almost 22 minutes behind the leader, slightly ahead of the best Finn, the eldest of the Lappalainen brothers, Tauno. They were both now behind the slow starting Norwegian Olav Kjelbotn, who had advanced from a modest 11th place to 4th, but without being able to catch up on the Swedish trio. Hedlund won the race with the biggest margin in Olympic skiing history, 13:27 ahead of silver medalist Jonsson, who was slightly ahead of the surprise bronze medalist, the substitute Andersson. The early leader Hegge struggled gallantly in to 5th place, over 25 minutes behind Hedlund, but was able to beat the best of the Finns, Tauno Lappalainen, by half a minute.

Fred Evans, the European champion from Great Britain, scored a contentious victory over Canada’s Custio Clayton whilst Frenchman Alexis Vastine exited the ring in floods of tears when he lost an unpopular decision to Shelestiuk. Inspired by the home crowd Evans then picked up an upset victory over Shelestiuk to book a meeting with Sapiyez in the gold medal decider. Up to the final Sapiyev had been amongst the most impressive performers in the whole boxing tournament and, despite the noise emanating from the home support, he was a class above his British opponent in each of the three rounds and kept up his nations’ record of winning at least one boxing title at each Olympic Games they have attended. For his performances Sapiyev was awarded the Val Barker Trophy for the outstanding boxer of the Games.

Norway crossed the finish line in a winning time of 19:22.9.
Finland’s duo Iivo Niskanen and Joni Mäki took the silver medal, 2.5 behind, while Aleksandr Bolshunov and Aleksandr Terentyev of the ROC captured bronze a further 1.8 behind.

In qualifying for the vault final she became the first Indian of either sex ever to qualify for an individual final since the qualification process of limiting the number of gymnasts on each piece of apparatus was introduced at Rome in 1960. Even if she finished eighth it would be the best ever finish by an Indian gymnast. She won the bronze medal at the 2014 Commonwealth Games and her performance was enhanced by her execution of the very difficult and dangerous Produnova vault. At the time of the Rio Olympics, Karmakar was one of only five gymnasts to have successfully completed this vault.
The Indian was not fancied for a gold medal, which looked certain to go to the new gymnastic sensation Simone Biles of the USA, who was winner of the all-round competition four days earlier. Strangely, Biles only came third on the horse vault at the 2015 World Championships and the two women who finished above her, Hong Un-jong of North Korea and Mariya Paseka of Russia, were likely to collect the other two medals in Rio. Paseka was the 2015 World Champion and bronze medallist in London 2012. Un-jong was the 2014 World Champion.
Un-jong set the mark, as she was the first to compete, with a score of 14.900, which was not likely to keep her in the lead for long. Remarkably after the next two gymnasts, Shallon Olsen of Canada and Oksana Chusovitina of Uzbekistan had completed their vaults, Un-jong was still in the lead but then Wang Yan of China topped her score with 14.999. Giulia Steingruber of Switzerland, who qualified as third best vaulter, became the new leader with 15.216. Then Karmakar went into second place after a Tsukahama gave her 14.866 points and then the Produnova and its difficulty rating of 7.00 gave her 15.266 for a score of 15.066. She was in the silver medal position with just two to go – but what a two; Paseka and Biles.
The Russian was up next and Paseka put in two vaults that yielded similar scores for an average 15.253. Biles headed the qualifiers with 16.050 but couldn’t match that in the final after her very difficult Amanar vault was not quite up to her high standard. Her 15.966, however, still gave her victory by 0.713 points and make it three golds out of three events. To put her winning margin into perspective, the difference between second placed Maria Paseka’s 15.253 and last placed Shallon Olsen’s 14.816 was only 0.437. For bronze medal winner Steingruber, she had the distinction of becoming the first Swiss gymnast, male or female to win an Olympic medal.

The points were based on 60% for Compulsory Figures and 40% for Free Skating, with the tiebreaker for each judge being Compulsory Figure Points.  Final placement was determined by a Majority Placement rule.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.  Ties broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the pairs were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each pair determined who was ranked higher.  The tiebreakers were, in order: 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals, 2) Total Points, 3) Compulsory Figure Points.",na,"The gold medal in 1956 and 1960 had been won by Americans Tenley Albright and Carol Heiss. The American heir apparent seemed to be youthful Laurie Owen, who won the 1961 US and North American Championship after placing sixth at the 1960 Olympics. But Owen was killed in the plane crash that took the lives of the entire US figure skating team travelling to the 1961 World Championships. In 1962, Barbara Ann Roles, bronze medalist in 1960 who had retired after Squaw Valley, came out of retirement to help support the US figure skating program. But she skated only one year and the US women’s program would be led by several very young skaters.
Sjoukje Dijkstra (NED) had been silver medalist behind Heiss at Squaw Valley. Even with Owen around, she would have been formidable in Innsbruck. She had won the World Championship in 1962-63, had been favored in 1961 prior to the American plane crash, and was European Champion from 1961-64. She won the gold medal in 1964 easily. She led the compulsory figures, ranking first on eight of nine judges’ cards, with one judge placing her equal first. Dijkstra then won the free skating, again ranked first by eight of nine judges. Overall, she was placed first by all judges. Behind her the silver medal went to Austria’s Regine Heitzer, with a narrow margin over Canada’s Petra Burka. The three young US women placed 6-7-8, led by Peggy Fleming in sixth. Much more would soon be heard of her.
Figure skating was barely known in the Netherlands prior to Dijkstra’s ascendance to the top levels of the sport. Her father was former Olympic speed skater, Lou Dijkstra, who had her train abroad with foreign coaches, notably 1948 men’s silver medalist Hans Gerschwiler. She was quite popular in the Netherlands and the Dutch Royal Family was in attendance to watch her win the gold medal. After the Olympics she joined the professional ice show, Holiday on Ice.

Young finished first but was disqualified and Braun was advanced to the final, where he would compete against four Americans - Reidpath, Lindberg, Ted Meredith, and Carroll Haff.
The first round and semi-finals had been run without lanes.  But the Braun/Young incident changed that and strings were put up for the final, and the runners ran in lanes.  Braun took the lead until he was passed on the last curve by Reidpath.  Reidpath held on to narrowly defeat Braun, with Lindberg taking the bronze medal.

India, which had always competed since their debut in 1928, was eliminated by Great-Britain in one of the qualifying tournaments. Although the last medal of the 8-time Olympic champion had been back in 1980, their failure to qualify was considered an upset on the subcontinent.
India’s absence did not affect the list of favourites, which consisted of the traditional powerhouses Australia, Germany, Netherlands and Spain. Germany had won the last two World Cups, as well as the 2007 Champions Trophy. However, they had trouble qualifying at the European Championships. At that event, Belgium, which had not competed since 1976, took the bronze ahead of Germany, forcing the World Champions to one of the three Qualifying Tournaments. Of the other favorites, the Dutch team had won the 2007 Europeans, beating Spain, while defending Olympic champion Australia had lost the past two World Cup finals to the Germans.
The round robin stage went pretty much as expected, with the four favourites going through to the semi-finals. Both contests were close affairs. Germany only defeated the Netherlands after a penalty shootout, while Spain came back from 0-2 behind to dismiss Australia 3-2. The final was not as exciting, both teams playing defensively. A single penalty corner, scored by Christopher Zeller, gave Germany the decisive lead after 16 minutes. Germany’s title added a new chapter in the family history of the Kellers. Striker Florian Keller joined his grandfather, father, brother and sister as Olympic medallists.

Unlike the 1896 Olympics, it could be said that all the top hurdlers were present, mainly because Al Kraenzlein was so dominant that he had no real peer.
The heats bore no surprises, as the favored Kraenzlein qualified easily.  In the final, the first real problem with the inexperienced French starter Meier, occurred.  John McLean caught a flyer, and according to reports, was ahead of Kraenzlein by five yards off the blocks.  But Kraenzlein was so superior that he caught McLean at the eighth hurdle and ran away to win by three yards.  McLean did hold onto second place, however, just edging out Fred Moloney, who had beaten McLean easily in a first-round heat.
Kraenzlein’s win in the 110 metres hurdles was the first of his four individual gold medals, a record which has still never been equalled in track & field athletics.  The distance of 110 metres was rarely run in either Britain or the United States, as they used the slightly shorter Imperial equivalent of 120 yards.  Thus, Kraenzlein’s mark of 15.6 and his final mark of 15.4 were world records for the metric distance, although both were intrinsically inferior to his record of 15.2 for 120 yards hurdles.

He had not been defeated internationally since the 1977 World All-Arounds, and in January 1980, had broken the world record, posting 1:54.79 in Davos only a month before the Olympics. His biggest competition was expected to come from two Norwegians, Jan Egil Storholt and Kai Arne Stenshjemmet. Storholt had been second at the last three World All-Arounds, to Heiden, and was the 1977 and 1979 European All-Around Champion, but his 1,500 PR was 1:55.18, not far from Heiden’s world record, and the previous world mark, but it had been set at the Kazakh speed factory of Medeo. Stenshjemmet usually had trouble beating Storholt, placing second to him at the 1977 and 1979 Europeans, and third at the 1979 World All-Around, and his 1,500 best was much slower than Storholt’s, at 1:57.50. Storholt started in the first pair and posted 1:57.95 on the slow Lake Placid ice. Nobody in the second or third pairs bettered that time, and it came down to Heiden and Stenshjemmet, skating together in the fourth pair. Heiden set off at a mad pace, posting 24.49 for the first 300 metres and was well ahead. But near the end of the second lap, at about 600 metres, he hit a rut in the ice, and almost fell, having to put down a hand to steady himself. It seemingly cost him up to a second in time, but it mattered little, as he recovered easily and defeated Stenshjemmet by slightly over 1¼ seconds in 1:55.44. Stenshjemmet’s time would be good enough for his second silver medal, adding to one from the 5K. Skating in the next pair, another Norwegian, Terje Andersen, posted 1:56.92 for the bronze medal. Heiden now had four gold medals, tieing him with Lidiya Skoblikova , who in 1964 had won all four women’s speed skating events. He had only the 10K left to conquer.

A relatively small judoka at 1.70 metres, compared to Orucov’s 1.80 metres for example, Ono was World Champion in 2013 and 2015 and probably one of the sport’s strongest favorites in Rio. Earlier in his career, Ono was involved in an act of violence against younger students at the Tenri University’s judo club, leading to a temporary suspension and preventing him from defending his world title in 2014. But in Rio, Ono was in impressive form.
On his way to the gold medal, Ono won four of five bouts by Ippon including a win against the veteran and surprise bronze medalist Dirk Van Tichelt from Belgium. Only the other bronze medalist, Georgia’s Lasha Shavdatuashvili, the London 2012 gold medalist in the 66 kg division, resisted the full five minutes, although Ono scored a Waza-ari after just 37 seconds.

Since the 1996 Olympics, the four world titles had been won by four different cyclists, with the 2000 title going to France’s Miguel Martinez. The 1996 silver medalist, Thomas Frischknecht (SUI), tried to steal the race early and led after the first four laps but he was then passed by Martinez and Belgium’s Filip Meirhaeghe. Martinez quickly broke Meirhaeghe and won the gold medal by over a minute.
Martinez had not only won the 2000 World title, but also the World Cup, hence dominating the season. His father was Mariano Martinez, who won two stages (1978, 1980) and the polka dot jersey (1978) in the Tour de France. In July 2004, Meirhaeghe was caught using EPO, and was suspended for two years.  He admitted to doping, but was able to make a comeback and compete at the 2008 Olympics. Frischknecht was a veteran, having been runner up at the Worlds in 1990-92. He again finished second in 1996, but moved into first when the winner was later disqualified for doping.  He was also a former World Championship runner-up in cyclo-cross, as his father had been.
In 22nd place was Michael Rasmussen (DEN), the 1999 World Champion. Rasmussen would soon turn to road racing, and won the polka dot jersey as King of the Mountains at the 2005-2006 Tour de France. In 2005, he was in third place in GC entering the penultimate stage, an individual time trial. But obviously not a time trialist, he fell several times, endured several bike changes, placed 77th in the stage, and dropped to seventh overall. In 2007, Rasmussen again put on the polka dot jersey, and actually held the yellow jersey as leader of the Tour after 16 stages and seemed assured of victory. But he was then withdrawn by his Rabobank team when he was found to have evaded doping controls several times, by frequently failing to report his location. A future two-time runner-up in the Tour de France also in this race was Australian Cadel Evans, who placed seventh, but later turned to road racing.

Burke had died in January 2012 after a training accident in which she fell on her head at the Park City, Utah superpipe. She died nine days later from the effects of her head injury. In her memory, the skiiers tried to wear black armbands but the International Olympic Committee, in a petty ruling, would not allow that. Burke’s coach, Trennon Paynter did something better, spreading her ashes over the halfpipe course where they remain in the snow of Sochi as a tribute.
In Burke’s absence the favorite was American Maddie Bowman, who had won the superpipe at the last two Winter X-Games. Bowman came through under the pressure and won the inaugural freestyle halfpipe gold medal, followed by France’s Marie Martinod. Martinod was a 29-year-old mother of one who had been retired for several years until Burke called her to tell her that halfpipe was going to be an Olympic event. She had come out retirement to compete, though her performance made it hard to tell she had ever been away. The bronze went to Japan’s Ayana Onozuka who held the same spot at the 2013 World Championships. Skiier after skiier looked to the sky and pointed up as they finished their run, remembering the one who could not be there. Referring to Burke, gold medalist Bowman said, “It takes all of us to put on her shoes.”

The 1947 European Champion had been the Soviet Union, but they did not participate in the 1948 Olympics, so by default, the Americans were still considered the heavy favorites.
The bulk of the United States came from the University of Kentucky, which won the NCAA Championship in 1948, and would repeat in 1949.  Players from several club teams that had competed in a US Trials were also chosen to make up the final US Olympic basketball team.  Among these was Don Barksdale, the first black man to compete in Olympic basketball.  Barksdale had previously been an AAU champion in the triple jump in 1944, and played club ball for the Oakland Bittners.

Burroughs had lost twice in one day after losing twice, period, in his international career, and was off the Olympic podium. He wept in his wife’s arms.
In the 74 kg final, which saw several medical timeouts, the World bronze medalist Geduyev dominated the first period to take a 6-0 lead over the 21-year-old Iranian Hassan Yazdani, who entered the 2016 Rio Olympics having already been crowned 2014 World Junior champion and 2015 World Championship 70 kg silver medalist.  Yazdani was able to take advantage of the fact that Geduyev was bleeding profusely from his forehead and not able to make the moves he normally might have been able to. Coming through with three takedowns in the last period, the final one coming with eight seconds on the clock, Yazdani won the gold medal in dramatic fashion.
European champion Soner Demirtaş of Turkey blanked Galymzhan Userbayev from Kazakhstan 6-0 in the first bronze-medal match, earning his first world-level medal, while Azerbaijan’s Cəbrayıl Həsənov bounced back from his semi-final loss, beating Abdurakhmonov 9-7 for the other bronze.

China’s Shi Tingmao was the only woman to win two gold medals in Rio and was a clear favourite to add another in Tokyo. At the 2019 World Championships Tingmao and Wang Han occupied first and second place in the springboard event, just as they had done two years earlier. They were also fresh from winning the synchronised title at Tokyo 2020.
It was hard to imagine anybody, other than the two Chinese divers, occupying the gold and silver position, but the best chance of the bronze medal was with the Canadians Jennifer Abel and Pamela Ware. Abel had finished second, with Mélissa Citrini-Beaulieu, behind Tongmao and Han in the synchronised event three days earlier. Abel medalled behind Tingmao and Han at the 2017 World Championships, but beat the two Chinese divers to win the 2019 World Series. Kim Su-Ji of Korea was third in the 1-metre springboard event at the 2019 World Championships and was a possible threat to the Canadians for the bronze medal.
Tingmao and Han dominated the preliminary round, scoring 350.45 and 347.25 respectively, with Abel and Ware next, but approximately 20 points behind. Japan’s Sayaka Mikami was fifth while the leading American was Hailey Hernandez. Tingmao led from the first round of dives, and while Han dropped to fourth at one stage, she pulled herself back into it with good fourth and fifth dives.
The Chinese pair dominated the semi-final that reduced the field from 18 to 12, but it was Han who led after the first three dives, with Tingmao down in joint seventh after her opening dive. Dive four, however, saw her outscore Han by more than 18 points and leapfrog her into first place. She stayed there, with Tingmao qualifying for the final in second place.
Abel always looked like qualifying and was never lower than third place. Her fellow Canadian Pamela Ware, however, was eliminated in 18th place after failing to score with her last dive. She was forced to abandon the dive after mis-stepping on the board and just jumped feet first into the water instead of possibly injuring herself if she dived. A similar thing happened to Mexico’s Arantxa Chávez during her third dive in the preliminary round.
For the Chinese pair, the final was no different, with Tingmao dominating proceedings from the first dive and winning her fourth gold over the past two Olympics, by 34.75 points from Han. A delighted Krysta Palmer of the United States, a mixed team bronze medallist in the 2018 World Cup, took bronze thanks to a forward 2.5 somersault with two twists with her final dive that yielded 73.10 and put her ahead of Malaysia’s Nur Dhabitah Binti Sabri. Abel was a favourite to secure bronze going into the final and after two dives was in the bronze medal position. After a failed reverse 2.5 somersaults in the third round, she scored just 39.00 points and slipped to ninth, never recovering.
China won their ninth consecutive springboard gold medal, and Shi Tingmao re-confirmed that she was the leading female diver in the world and two further golds in Tokyo took her total of Olympic and World gold medals to 12.

There was no suspense over the winner of the event, however, as Spain’s Johann Mühlegg, a German émigré who obtained Spanish citizenship in 1999, dominated, taking the lead early, and winning by over two full minutes. Austrians Christian Hoffmann and Mikhail Botvinov, who had changed citizenship from Russia in 1996, finished second and third. At least the battle for the other medals was close, as Norwegian biathlon star Ole Einar Bjørndalen led the pack coming into the final lap, but was passed by the Austrians and Italian Pietro Piller Cottrer. Norway’s Kristen Skjeldal also passed Bjørndalen, who originally finished sixth. In the end, these five would battle out the medals over the final lap, with less than 13.5 seconds separating them, as Hoffmann outsprinted Botvinov to the line, winning by 1.3 seconds.
But two weeks later it would all change. On 23 February, Mühlegg won the 50 km, his third gold medal in Salt Lake City as he had also won the pursuit, only to fail his doping screen, testing positive for darbopoietin, an erythropoietin analogue. He lost the 50 km, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in December 2003 that he could be stripped of all three gold medals from the 2002 Winter Olympics. So the final standings eventually saw Hoffmann elevated to the gold medal, Botvinov the silver, and Skjeldal the bronze. As the FIS now changes the Winter Olympic program frequently, this was also the last 30 km race, at least for some time, as it was not held in 2006 or 2010, having first been contested at the Olympics in 1956.

At a March World Cup, Chris Witty (USA) set the mark at 1:14.58. It was taken back by former record holder Monique Gabrecht-Enfeldt (Germany) at the World Championships a week later, lowering it to 1:14.13. Her compatriot Sabine Völker then again improved the time at World Cup on the Olympic ice, clocking 1:14.06. In addition to these women, defending champion Marianne Timmer (Netherlands) and Jennifer Rodriguez had also won World Cup races during the ongoing season.
Timmer was the first to beat 1:15, well below her Olympic Record from 1998. Next up was Witty, who faced 500 m champion Catriona Le May Doan. The Canadian went off very quickly, and was still leading at the bell. But while Le May slowed down in the final lap, Witty finished very quickly (28.90), and broke the 1:14 barrier for a world record of 1:13.83. Her final lap time was only beaten by Rodriguez in the next pair (28.61), but her first 600 m had been slower, and she ended with 1:14.24. Sabine Völker then seemed set to match Witty’s time, but narrowly missed it, coming home in 1:13.93. As Garbrecht also failed on the final lap, the title went to Witty. That came as a surprise, as Witty had needed to cut back on training all season. According to Witty, that was due to mononucleosis, but she later revealed a different reason. She had been sexually abused as a child by a family friend, and had experienced a lot of trouble dealing with this emotionally in the run-up to the Salt Lake Games.

The Norwegians Kjetil Jansrud and Aksel Lund Svindal were the big favorites, after finishing first (Svindal) and second (Jansrud) in the downhill the day before. Jansrud was also the defending champion from 2014 and led the ongoing Super G World Cup with Svindal in second. The Norwegians also ruled the years before, as the last four Super G Crystal Globes were won by Jansrud (2014/15 and 2016/17), Svindal (2013/14) and Kilde (2015/16). This winter season had seen four out of six World Cup Super Gs won by different skiers as Jansrud won in Lake Louise, Kriechmayr in Beaver Creek, Ferstl in Val Gardena, and Svindal in Kitzbühel.
With a total of seven podium finishes the Austrians would be the primary medal contenders with all four of their racers in this event having top three World Cup finishes prior to PyeongChang. Hannes Reichelt was also the 2015 World Champion, while the reigning 2017 World Champion, Erik Guay, missed the Olympics due to a back injury. The other 2014 medalists, Weibrecht and Hudec, this time for the Czech Republic and no longer competing for Canada, returned to the Games, but both did not finish here. The second bronze medalist from Sochi, Bode Miller, was by now retired.
The starting order for speed events was changed since the last Olympics. The top 10 racers of the World Cup Starting List (WCSL), beginning with the leader, could choose an odd bib number from 1-19, while the next ten racers from the WCSL could choose an even bib number from 2-20. As expected Jansrud set the pace, when coming down with bib #7 and taking the lead 0.51 seconds ahead of Kriechmayr. Coming down with bib #9 Svindal placed second 31/100ths of a second behind his compatriot, but the Norwegian pair was already blown-up when Blaise Giezendanner, bib #10, claimed second place only 2/10ths of a second behind Jansrud. The Frenchman had not been considered a medal contender as he did not race in the Combined nor in the downhill event and his best Super G finish in a World Cup event ever was an eighth place back in February 2016.
The winner was wearing bib #15 and the win went to Austria, when Matthias Mayer was 18/100ths of a second faster than Jansrud. His win was only in danger when Beat Feuz left the start house next, having already won bronze in the downhill. Feuz finished second, only 0.13 seconds slower, but beat Jansrud by 0.05 second, with Griezendanner fourth and Svindal fifth.
After his downhill gold medal in Sochi, Mayer became the second skier to win the Olympic speed double, only one day after Svindal achieved this by winning the downhill. Mayer won the race with an average speed of 99 km/h and was 3.57 metres ahead of Feuz at the finish. As in the downhill, Head again made a clean sweep of the medals, with the top five finishers using their skis.

Since then the Germans (East Germany in 1988) had taken the gold medal every time but twice, losing it to Hungary in 1992 and 2012. In the World Championships, Hungary earned the title eleven times and Germany or East Germany twelve times since its Olympic debut, with Germany not having won since 2007. In 2015, however, Belarus became the first nation other than Germany or Hungary to win the event at the World Championships since Bulgaria in 1977. Belarus was the bronze medallist in London, as well as at the 2011, 2013, and 2014 World Championships, and was also the 2015 European Champion, leaving many to wonder if a new Olympic Champion would be crowned for the first time in 32 years.
Belarus and Hungary won their preliminary heats, while Germany finished third in Hungary’s heat behind the Ukrainians, who were the 2015 World runners-up. Germany then breezed through the semifinal, with New Zealand winning the other heat. The final was less nail-biting than it had been in the past, although Hungary and Germany retained their considerable lead over the rest of the field. Hungary won with nearly a second to spare over Germany, who in turn was over a second and a half ahead of Belarus.

Bouwmeester was the defending gold medallist while Rindom had won the bronze medal at Rio in 2016. Bouwmeester was World Champion in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020, and was runner-up in 2015 and 2018-19. Rindom had won the Worlds in 2015 and 2019 and won bronze medals at Worlds in 2016 and 2018. The battle for gold in Enoshima was expected to be between these two.
This was the largest class in Tokyo sailing with 44 sailors coming to the start line. Bouwmeester and Rindom got off to slow starts and after four races stood fifth and third, respectively. Rindom moved into the lead after the sixth race although she had not won a race but had consistent top finishes. After the eighth race, which Rindom finally won, Bouwmeester was in seventh place, partly due to a black flag disqualification in race seven, but she won the ninth race and moved up to second behind Rindom, who had a commanding lead by then. Still in medal contention were Belgian Emma Plasschaert and Sweden’s Josefin Olsson, who were third and fourth, respectively.
In the 10th race Rindom did not finish and her last place points caused her to have to count her only earlier poor finish. She still led but Bouwmeester had closed the gap and Olsson was third going into the medal race. Olsson won the medal race to win the silver medal, pushing Bouwmeester, who placed sixth, back to bronze as Plasschaert missed the podium. Rindom was seventh in the medal race but still held on for the gold medal. She struggled when her self-bailer did not work well as it was clogged with seaweed.
Bouwmeester completed a full set of medals in the event, as she had won silver at London in 2012 in addition to her gold medal at Rio. Rindom’s gold medal was the first for Denmark in this event, and their second in women’s sailing, as Kristine Roug had won gold in the one-person dinghy when it was raced in the Europe class in 1996.

The other top American was Dave Sime, whose best year was 1956, but an injury kept him off the Olympic team. They were joined by Villanova’s Frank Budd and it was expected that the 100 gold medal would remain in American hands. But there was a European threat. Germany’s Armin Hary had won the 1958 European Championships, and was known for his outstanding starts. In June 1960 he became the first man to run 100 metres in 10 seconds flat. That mark was equaled in July by Canada’s Harry Jerome. Jerome did not get thru the Olympic semi-finals, but Hary, Sime, Budd, and Norton did, joined in the final by Britain’s Peter Radford and Cuba’s Enrique Figuerola. In the final, Hary false started but despite this, he again got off to a superb start. He led throughout the race, but Sime closed quickly, after trailing badly at 50 metres. But he could not quite catch Hary, who won the gold medal with Sime in second, and Peter Radford winning the bronze medal. Ray Norton came in last in the final and the Roma Olympics were not kind to him. He also finished last in the 200 final, and in the 4x100 metre relay, he and Frank Budd passed the baton out of the zone, leading to a USA disqualification.

Seven jumpers were alive after 1.85 metres (6-0¾), but at 1.88 (6-2) only three cleared – Gusenbauer in her second attempt, but home crowd favorite Ulrike Meyfarth and Yordanka Blagoeva (BUL) had first attempt clearances. At 1.90 (6-2¾), Meyfarth cleared on her second jump and won the gold medal. She went on to better the world record with 1.92 (6-3½). Meyfarth was only 16-years-old in 1972 – actually 16 years, 123 days on the day of her victory, and she remains the youngest winner of an individual medal in track & field athletics.

The IOC had recognized the FIVB as the governing body of beach volleyball, although most of the top men professionals played on the AVP Tour. The FIVB ruled that AVP players had to qualify via FIVB events. Originally only two teams per nations were to be allowed, but because of the dispute between the FIVB and AVP, three teams from any country could compete. The #1 seed was the Brazilian team of Lopes and Neto, who would finish only equal ninth. The big story in Atlanta was the two rival American teams from the competing tours. Sinjin Smith (Sinjin is short for his middle name of St. John) and Carl Henkel played on the FIVB tour. The top AVP team consisted of Kent Steffes and Karch Kiraly. Kiraly had led the US to indoor gold medals in 1984 and 1988, and was considered the greatest volleyball player in the world. Originally a beach partner of Sinjin Smith, he and Smith no longer got on well, further inflaming the rivalry.  The third US team consisted of Mike Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh, who also played on the AVP Tour. The match of the tournament occurred in the quarter-finals between Kiraly/Steffes and Smith/Henkel. Smith and Henkel went ahead 12-8, and had match point at both 14-13 and 15-14. Kiraly and Steffes fought off four match points to win, 17-15. The final came down to the two AVP teams, with Kiraly/Steffes defeating Dodd/Whitmarsh in two sets, 12-5, 12-8.

The surprise Beijing gold medalist had been Belgian Tia Hellebaut, who promptly retired to have a baby, but she returned to jumping in late 2011, although she was less of a factor. With those two not available at top form, the favorite going in was Anna Chicherova, the Russian who had won the 2011 Worlds. Her biggest competition was expected to be American Chaunté Lowe.
In the end it was all Chicherova who started with an opening clearance at 1.89, and was perfect through 2.03. Lowe struggled, going out at 2.00 and would finish only sixth due to misses. Surprising young American Brigetta Barrett cleared 2.03 on her second attempt, to place her second at that time, and Russian Svetlana Shkolina also cleared, on her third attempt, placing her third. All three attempted 2.05, but only Chicherova was successful, after one miss, giving her the gold medal. Barrett secured the silver and Shkolina the bronze. Hellebaut placed fifth.
In February 2019 the bronze medalist, Svetlana Shkolina (RUS), was disqualified by a ruling of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for an anti-doping rules violation (ADRV). In November 2021 the IOC announced that Spain’s Ruth Beitía had been advanced to the bronze medal position.

Ragettli topped the qualification round rankings, with Goepper third and Birk Ruud of Norway in between.

In the final James and Norman were out fastest with James holding a narrow lead at the halfway mark, as Gardiner was a good three metres back. At 300 metres, James still led but Gardiner had closed on the final turn and was close.

She was hoping to add this gold medal in her quest to win five golds at the Sydney Olympics – 100, 200, long jump, and both relays. She had won the 100/200 at the US Olympic Trials and was the top sprinter in the world. She did “win” the 200 as well, quite easily, and would later add a third gold medal in the 4x400. She succeeded in winning five medals, adding a bronze in the long jump, and surprisingly only a bronze in the 4x100 when the United States was upset by the Bahamas and Jamaica. In the 200 the surprise third-place finisher was Sri Lanka’s Susanthika Jayasinghe who won that nation’s first medal under that name, their only other Olympic medal won in 1948 by 400 hurdler Duncan White, when the nation was called Ceylon.
But the results of this event and every 2000 event in which Marion Jones competed are not what they seem. Dogged by rumors of drug use, Jones had chosen some unusual bedfellows for husbands. In 2000 she was married to shot putter C. J. Hunter and during the Sydney Olympics it was revealed that he tested positive for steroids several times earlier in the year. They later divorced, and she then married sprinter Tim Montgomery. In 2003 he was found to have participated with the BALCO Scandal and was banned for two years by the IAAF. In 2006 Jones almost tested positive for the only time in her career, with a sample showing use of eryrthropoietin (EPO) after the US Championships. But her B sample was negative and it was not considered a positive drug test. Shortly thereafter Montgomery was charged in a check-kiting scheme and Jones was implicated as well, and they later divorced. She then married Barbadian sprinter Obadele Thompson, who had, at least, no drug charges against him. In October 2007, Jones admitted to federal prosecutors that she had lied to them and had used steroids in the months prior to the Sydney Olympics. Her 2000 results were stricken by the IAAF and the medals were returned to the IOC.

Her biggest rival was Russian Irina Slutskaya, who had placed second to Kwan three times at the Worlds, but had won four European Championships by 2002 – she would eventually win that title seven times. Kwan got off to a good start, narrowly winning the short program with Slutskaya second, five first places to four. Young American Sasha Cohen was third after the short, followed by another young American, Sarah Hughes. Cohen was only 18 and Hughes 16, but both were thought to have great potential for the future. In the free skate, Hughes would show how close the future was. She was the first leader to skate in the free program and was solid, but not spectacular, receiving all scores of 5.7 and 5.8. Kwan was next and when she nearly fell early on a triple flip, putting down both hands, she was finished. Her technical scores were mostly 5.6 and 5.7, and better artistic scores could not undo the damage. Slutskaya was the final skater and the title was hers if she could skate cleanly. She almost did, but a few of her landings were less than her best, and her scores were variable, ranging from 5.6 to 5.9. The free skate went to Hughes, five first places to four for Slutskaya. They then tied with 3.0 factored placements, but the free skate was the tiebreaker, giving the gold medal to Hughes, with Kwan winning a bronze medal. Slutskaya was very upset with her artistic scores, as were several of the Russian skaters, and the Russian Federation filed a protest, which was disallowed. Because of injuries in 2006, Michelle Kwan would not make the Olympic team. Her Olympic career ended in 2002, and she is likely the greatest skater never to win Olympic gold.

The reigning World Champion at the distance, Zinaida Amosova, was not present, however, failing to qualify for the Soviet Olympic team.
At the halfway point, East Germany’s Barbara Petzold had taken the lead, almost 14 seconds ahead of Smetanina, with the other favorites closely following: the silver medalist from the 5 km race Hilkka Riihivuori in third, only 0.3 seconds behind Smetanina, then Takalo in fourth, another 1.9 seconds behind, and Kulakova in fifth place, 6 seconds behind Takalo. Kulakova was the first of the favorites to finish, but Takalo, starting half a minute behind, immediately took over the lead, finishing 13 seconds ahead of the Soviet veteran. Then everybody’s eyes were on the 24-year old leader Petzold. She finished 14 seconds stronger than Takalo, and Riihivuori, chasing Petzold from behind, arriving 3.5 seconds too late to beat the leading German woman. The final challenger was Smetanina, the winner of the 5 km race three days earlier. To everybody’s surprise she faded in the last part of the race and dropped down to fourth, outside the medal podium, 9 seconds behind Takalo.
Even if Petzold’s victory was a minor surprise, she had earlier shown great promise on the cross-country track. In 1974, at only 18-years-old, she won the silver medal at 10 km at the World Championships in Falun. In the 1976 Games she placed seventh at the distance, but her later progress was hampered by overtraining. She became the first ever German to win an Olympic cross-country gold medal.

But in 1932 he started strongly by winning the horse steeplechase and placing equal second with the sword. After two phases he narrowly led America’s Richard Mayo. But shooting was again a problem for Lindman, as he placed 19th with the pistol.

Losing quarter-finalists plus losers to the winners played for 2nd and 3rd place.",na,"At the 1984 Olympics, the qualifying round matches in the football tournament were spread all over the United States, a situation similar to that which exists in the World Cup tournament. The first time this occurred in international matches was in the 1920 Olympics. While the bulk of the matches were played in Antwerp (although in two different stadia), some early round matches were played in Gent and St. Gilles. From the quarter-finals onward, and including the second- and third-place matches, most of the matches were played in the Beerschot Stadium, the main Olympic Stadium.
Not all the world’s top football nations were present at Antwerp. Germany and Hungary did not compete, as the nations were not invited to the 1920 Olympics because of their role in World War I. Great Britain almost did not compete. In early 1919, England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales withdrew from FIFA and formed their own federation, the Federation of National Football Association. Surprisingly, the United States protested Britain’s presence in the 1920 football tournament, since Great Britain was no longer a FIFA member. Belgium and France supported this motion, but Great Britain was allowed to compete. Among the original 15 entries, Switzerland withdrew, officially for financial reasons, but in reality the football community in the country was hopelessly split over sporting contacts with Germany. After French speaking Swiss boycotted a friendly match against Germany in June, the Deutschschweizer insisted the nation withdraw from the Games, leaving 14 nations in the field.
In the semi-final between the Czech and French teams, the Dutch referee replaced the Czech linesmen after he was accused of showing bias towards his countrymen and a local official took his place for the last half hour of the game.
The final round match of the 1920 football tournament was contested between Belgium and Czechoslovakia. The referee was supposedly neutral, John Lewis, a Brit. But the Czechs were not pleased with his selection, as according to the Czech player Sedláček, he had been the victim of violence at a match in Praha and wanted revenge on the Czechs. In addition, the crowd of 40,000 was decidedly in favor of the home team. Langenus described the scene, “Both by the side of the stands and by the side of the terraces, waves of people penetrated the stadium, overrunning all obstacles … The Olympic trench had grown into an enormous gate via which thousands poured in. A cordon of soldiers was thrown round the sidelines in an attempt to at least keep the crowd off the playing field. All around the stadium, fans were handing like bunches of grapes from the colonnades and from the trees.”
Belgium took an early lead, scoring at the 6- and 30-minute mark to lead 2-0. The Czechs were becoming very upset over Lewis’s calls. Finally, after a foul was called against Karel Steiner on Robert Coppée at the 39-minute mark, the Czech team left the field, withdrawing in protest of the officiating. They could not be convinced to return to the field and the Belgians were declared the Olympic champions.
The Czechoslovakian team was disqualified and not awarded second place. Their protest was not allowed, the terms of which read as follows (translated from the French):


We were granted an English linesman, which was a contradiction against the published rules, in which it was noted that each participating nation had the right to two linesmen. This rules violation was an important prejudice against us, because the English linesman was not impartial and that is why we demand the annulment of the match.


Most of the decisions by the referee M. Lewis were incorrect and it was evident that he was prejudiced against our team. Also, both of the goals were marked by Belgians only, but after false decisions of the judge, and we demand a rigorous inquiry on this point.


In the course of the match, the Belgian soldiers were introduced as one, and they encircled the field and their provocative and menacing conduct prevented our team from being able to play a peaceful and regulated game. After the regrettable incident at the end of the match, a wild mob of soldiers destroyed our flag at the end in a manner that we were unable to continue to participate until a satisfactory apology for the destruction of our flag was made to the entire team.


The football tournament was to be decided by the Bergvall System, in which teams losing to the champions then contested a new tournament for second place, and then a separate third-place tournament was held among all teams losing to the winners and runners-up. A new tournament was thus begun to determine the second place team. Czechoslovakia had been disqualified in the final, and thus did not compete in the second-place tournament. The second-place tournament began on 30 August, with teams that had lost in early rounds playing off to get into the tournament. The tournament proper began late on 2 September, after the final match “ended“. Many of the French players had already left Antwerp and were not available to play so the French did not field a team in the silver medal play-off tournament. As a losing semi-finalist, France would have been matched against the Netherlands, which lost in the semi-finals to Belgium. The other teams were playing off for the right to face the winner of the France-Netherlands match. When France withdrew, The Netherlands walked over into the second-place finals, where they faced Spain, losing 3-1.
In addition to their gold medals, the Belgian football team was awarded possession of the Challenge Prize that had been donated by The Football Association of England.

Italy’s victory at that event also put them in the mix for a potential Olympic medal.
The final featured the favourites, with France, the United States, and Romania filling out the field. The Netherlands and France set out fastest, with the latter’s Laura Tarantola and Claire Bove seeming intent on crashing the favourites’ party. Italy and Great Britain soon took up the challenge and joined the other two teams in a four-boat pack at the front. By the halfway point, less than a second separated the four and with only 500m to go it was still anyone’s race. At the end, in a classic photo finish, Italy took the victory by 0.14 seconds over the surprising French. It was a disappointing finish for the Dutch pair, who were well positioned to repeat their Olympic championship before a stroke of bad luck led them to “catch a crab” and grind their boat to a near-halt in the final metres, dropping them to bronze position which they narrowly held onto by the slimmest of margins: 0.01 seconds over the British.

The other medal challengers appeared to come from the USA, Italy and Austria.
The first run produced a series of shocks. At the head of the field were two Austrian family pairings and it was the Linger brothers who led from the more experienced Schiegl cousins. Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin, silver medallists in Salt Lake City, crashed out on turn 14 and minutes later the Ukrainian pairing went airborne on the same curve. Oleh Zherebytskiy was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Pinerolo after sustaining a head injury.
The second part of the competition was just as unpredictable as the first. The expected charge from Leitner and Resch failed to materialise and instead they dropped down the field to seventh.  The Schiegls also had a poor run and with only the Lingers to come the Florschütz and Wustlich team held onto the top position. Andreas and Wolfgang Linger needed only to finish within a tenth of a second of the Germans to become Olympic champions but instead they took a further two tenths off their rivals. The first Austrians to win this title since 1964, the Linger brothers had won the 2003 World Championships, but had not figured prominently in a major championship since then.

They dominated the competition in Sapporo, winning both the short program and free skate over their teammates, Lyudmila Smirnova and Andrey Suraykin. But there is a bit more to that story. Rodnina was considered the stronger skater of her pair, and Ulanov, who was weary of her mocking him, became romantically involved with Smirnova. They would eventually marry and after 1972, Rodnina and Ulanov split as a pair skating couple. In Sapporo, knowing what was to come, Rodnina, who had once had strong romantic feelings for Aleksey, left the ice in tears after their free skating performance.
Irina Rodnina would soon begin skating with Aleksandr Zaytsev and together they would win the next two Olympic pairs gold medals, six World Championships, and seven European Championships.

At the Holmenkollen competition in 1947, Nils Karlsson won the 18 km. race, followed by three countrymen and two Finns, with the best Norwegian placing seventh, almost four minutes behind the winner.
Karlsson was regarded as the favorite, but after a fast opening section he struggled with the thin air and finished in fifth place, last among the Swedes, save for the Nordic combined entrants.

For the Norwegians, the event was a great disappointment. Their best skier, Olav Hagen, came in ninth, beaten by Lundström by over five minutes.
Before 1948, Lundström had been unable to win a Swedish Championship, but this was his great year. Later in the season he won the Holmenkollen 18 km. race followed by four more Swedes, and he would also claim three Swedish titles – 18 km., 30 km. and as a member of his club’s relay team.

Britain’s Tom Daley was hoping to win a medal for the third consecutive Olympics and came to the Games as winner of the 2021 World Cup, held in the Tokyo Aquatics Centre.
Jian and Cao came through the preliminary round in first and second place with the 2019 World Championships bronze medalllst Oleksandr Bondar of the ROC third. Yang’s sixth and last dive was a forward 4.5 somersaults, which scored him 102.5 points. Tom Daley had a disastrous start, scoring just 56.10 on his first dive after all seven judges awarded him a meagre 5.5, and he was out of the top 18 qualifying places in 23rd. He clawed himself back into contention, however, and finished as the fourth highest scoring qualifier. He was hoping to win his second gold medal of the Games, having won the synchronised platform title with Matty Lee.
A lot of attention was pad to the new “wonder boy” of diving, 15-year-old Ukrainian Oleksiy Sereda, who stayed cool throughout the preliminaries to qualify for the semi-final in sixth place. He first rose to prominence in 2019 when he won the platform title at the European Championships when just aged 13, the sport’s youngest ever European champion.
It was much the same in the semi-final with the Chinese divers occupying the top two places, but with Cao first this time. The only surprise of the heat was Cao and Yang lying joint sixth after the opening dives with the Canadian Nathan Zsombor-Murray taking a slender lead from Bondar, who eventually qualified in third with Tom Daley fourth. As for Zsombor-Murray, he failed to qualify after finishing 13th.
In the final, Cao opened with a dive that scored 102.00, with Daley second and Yang third. Daley held the lead after his second and third dives with the Chinese divers alternatively occupying the silver and bronze medal positions. At the halfway stage, however, only 6.20 points separated the three men. The fourth round of dives was the one that effectively decided the outcome of the competition.
Daley made an error on entry into the water and slipped to third place while Cao went into the gold medal position. He held that lead going into the last round, and was 12.10 points of his fellow countryman. Yang’s final forward 4.5 somersaults with a degree of difficulty of 4.1, however, scored a massive 112.75 points to put pressure on Cao, who needed to score 100.65 to win. He gave an almost perfect back 2.5 somersaults with 2.5 twists to score 102.60 and capture the gold by just 1.95 points.
This event rounded off another successful diving competition for China, who won their seventh gold medal out of the eight available, and for Cao he made history as the first diver to win Olympic gold medals in three different events. He won the platform synchro in 2012, springboard individual at Rio, and now the individual platform title. Daley won a medal in his third consecutive Games and also became the first Briton to win four diving medals.

But in preparation for the 1912 Olympics, the Swedes devised another 10-event multi-event with more emphasis placed on speed and jumping ability.  The first known competitions in the decathlon were conducted on 15 October 1911, both in Münster, Germany (won by Karl von Halt) and Göteberg, Sweden (won by Hugo Wieslander).  In June 1912, Wieslander won two further Swedish decathlons in preparation for the Olympic Games.  He was the Swedish favorite.
The American favorite was a remarkable Native American named Jim Thorpe.  A descendant of the Sac and Fox tribe and an Irish father, Thorpe had starred in both football and baseball, as well as track, at the Carlisle Indian School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  He had never competed in a decathlon prior to Stockholm, but at the eastern U.S. Olympic Trial in the pentathlon, he was so dominant that he was named to represent the United States in both the decathlon and the pentathlon.  The Stockholm decathlon was expected to be a closely fought contest between Wieslander and Thorpe.
It was not.  One week after winning the pentathlon, Jim Thorpe won the decathlon by an almost laughable margin, establishing a new world record, and defeating Wieslander by almost 700 points.  He won three events, had one second place, four thirds, and two fourths in the ten events.  Using point-for-place scoring, he scored 25 points to Wieslander’s 67 and Charles Lomberg’s 75.
At the closing ceremonies, Thorpe was presented his trophies by Sweden’s King Gustav V.  The legend is that the King told him, “Sir, you are the greatest athlete in the world,” and that Thorpe replied, “Thanks, King.”  Whether the legend is true or not, the King was correct.  But from 1913 until 1982 the Olympic record books invariably listed Hugo Wieslander as the 1912 Olympic decathlon champion.
In January 1913, newspaper stories broke noting that Jim Thorpe had played minor league baseball in North Carolina in 1909 and 1910.  The United States AAU reacted quickly and declared Thorpe a professional.  The IOC followed suit.  Thorpe’s Olympic victories were taken from him and he was ordered to return his medals and trophies.
But the story never died.  For years, many efforts were made to right what many perceived as a wrong and have the medals, the trophies, and the recognition returned to Jim Thorpe or his family.  The trophies included the Challenge Trophy for the decathlon, which had been donated by the Czar of Russia.  In 1982, the International Olympic Committee made partial restitution when they restored Thorpe’s amateur status, and declared him, in an unusual ruling, co-champion with Hugo Wieslander.
The story of Thorpe’s disqualification, the many attempts to restore his name, and the final work done which succeeded, is a long and complicated one.  See the Jim Thorpe bio for further details. However, the official announcement from the IOC on 15 July 2022 is as follows: “On 15 July 2022, on the day of the 110th anniversary of Thorpe’s medal in decathlon, the IOC announced its decision to display the name of Jim Thorpe as the sole gold medallist in pentathlon and decathlon at the Olympic Games Stockholm 1912. The IOC explained in its communication that this development was possible after the engagement of the Bright Path Strong organisation, supported by IOC Member Anita DeFrantz, who had contacted the Swedish Olympic Committee (SOC) and the surviving family members of Hugo K. Wieslander, who had been named as the gold medallist in decathlon when Thorpe was stripped of his medals in 1913. The family had confirmed that Wieslander himself had never accepted the Olympic gold medal allocated to him, and had always been of the opinion that Jim Thorpe was the sole legitimate Olympic gold medallist. The same declaration was received from the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, whose athlete, Ferdinand Bie, was named as the gold medallist when Thorpe was stripped of the pentathlon title.”

He was at this time unequaled as a discus thrower and as an all-around athlete.  Born in Bohola, County Mayo, Ireland, Martin Sheridan emigrated to the United States in 1900, following his brother, Richard, who had come over in 1897.  Richard Sheridan quickly established himself in the United States as a discus thrower.  Martin Sheridan also took up the event and quickly became the best in the world at it.  Sheridan stood 6’3) and weighed 195 lbs. in his prime.
In the era when Sheridan competed, there was no official governing body that recognized world records.  Various sources credit him with between seven and sixteen world records.  Sheridan’s Olympic fame rests primarily on winning the Olympic gold medal in the discus in 1904, 1906, and 1908.  But he was far more than just a discus thrower.  Overall, he won nine Olympic medals, including five gold, counting those Sheridan won in the 1906 Olympics.
Sheridan was a superb jumper and weight thrower, but he displayed his other talents in the all-around championship, the early American forerunner of the decathlon.  Sheridan entered three all-arounds in his athletic career, the AAU National Championships of 1905, 1907, and 1909.  He won each of them easily, and set a world record each time, finally leaving it at 7,385 points, a mark which Jim Thorpe broke by only a few points in 1912.  Sheridan also won the AAU discus championship in 1904, 1906, 1907, and again in 1911, just before his retirement as an athlete.
Off the field, Sheridan worked as a policeman (1902-1918) as did many of the Irish-American athletes.  His fame led him to be the personal bodyguard for the governor of New York whenever he visited the city.  Sheridan never married and died without issue from pneumonia only seven years after he retired from athletics.  In the New York Herald-Tribune, his obituary proclaimed him to be the greatest all-around athlete ever known in the United States - greater even than Jim Thorpe.  Thorpe himself stated in the obituary, “Sheridan was the greatest athlete in the world.  He could do things I never could.”

The IOC decreed that the French sailing authorities should decide on the design of boat to be used and provided these boats for use at the Olympic Games. Unfortunately the number of entrants exceeded the number of boats available and a convoluted series of qualifying races had to be scheduled to eliminate just a single boat from the finals. The class was termed the Olympic Monotype, but was actually known as the Monotype national français (or French National Monotype), or Meulan, class, and was chosen as the monotype class by the Union des sociétés nautiques française (USNF). However, only 10 of the 16 boats were Monotype national français, with the other six slightly different and possibly of the very similar Belgian/Dutch Scheldejol class
Léon Huybrechts, a Belgian who had won silver medals in both 1908 and 1920, proved himself a master of the fickle French winds. He posted a comfortable victory in the first of the two races that made up the Olympic final then held off the challenge of the Dutch boat to win the second race and confirm himself as champion. Behind him there was a three-way tie for second place and so a tie-breaker race had to be scheduled. Spain’s Santiago Amat led at halfway but faltered badly and allowed Henrik Robert of Norway and Hans Dittmar of Finland to pass him and claim silver and bronze respectively.
Although she failed to reach the final stages, Swiss sailor Ella Maillart made a piece of history by becoming the first woman to skipper a boat in Olympic competition. Maillart, who also competed internationally in hockey and alpine skiing, later became better known as an adventurer and acclaimed travel writer.

Raisa Smetanina was the reigning World Champion, and also won silver at the inaugural event in 1978. The big question was if Marja-Liisa Hämälainen could win a clean sweep and take her third individual gold medal in Sarajevo. The 27-year old Finn, nicknamed the “Iron Maiden” by the Norwegian press, started in a controlled way, lying third at 3.5 km, 6.6 seconds behind the leader, Smetanina, but only 0.1 seconds behind Brit Pettersen from Norway, who was second. But Hämälainen soon took control of the race. At the halfway point, she was 13 seconds ahead of her Soviet rival, with Pettersen further behind but still in third place. At 13.5 km Smetanina was still in contention, only 12 seconds behind. Moving up from seventh to third was Czechoslovakia’s Blanka Paulů, but too far behind the leaders to fight for the gold medal. Norway’s Anne Jahren was five seconds behind Paulů, closely followed by Marie Risby, Lyubov Lyadova and Pettersen, all about ten seconds from the bronze medal position.
Jahren, with start number 4, took the early lead at the finish, and Lyadova, Paulů and Risby failed to beat Jahren’s final time, the Czech skiier finishing just three seconds back. Then Hämälainen finished strongly as usual, having beaten Jahren by half a minute over the last 6.5 km. Smetanina could not respond to Hämälainen’s finish, and won her second silver medal at the Sarajevo Games, beaten by over 40 seconds.
Marja-Liisa Hämälainen had made it, winning all three individual distances in the 1984 games. She had participated both in the 1976 and 1980 games without success, finishing 18th at 10 km in 1980 as her previous Olympic best. Now she was definitely the cross-country queen of the 1984 games. Later in 1984 she married her teammate Harri Kirvesniemi, and, under her new family name, participated in three more Winter Olympic Games, being the first woman to participate at six Winter Olympics.

The early favorite was C. K. Yang who had won the 1960 silver medal behind Rafer Johnson. But the event was in turmoil in 1964. In 1962, the pole vault was being converted to a fiberglass pole and the new heights achieved made pole vault points well out of proportion to the other events. Yang was a top pole vaulter and at the 1963 Mt. Sac Relays he shattered the world record with 9,121 points, breaking the record after only nine events, and clearing 4.84 [15-10½) in the vault in the process. Yang would later clear 5 metres [16-4¾) in the vault. The problem with the vault led officials to change the scoring tables the year before the Tokyo Olympics, which took away much of Yang’s dominance over the field. After that change, there was no clear favorite in Tokyo. Vasily Kuznetsov of the USSR had won the European Championships in 1954, 1958, and 1962, and had won bronze medals in both 1956 and 1960. But he was 32-years-old in 1964, and not at his best. At Tokyo, the gold medal went to the German Willi Holdorf, who had been German champion in 1960, 1961, and 1963. Yang was injured at Tokyo and was a well-beaten fifth, with Kuznetsov back in seventh.

Vlhová had even more problems, finishing only 12th and more than 1.2 seconds behind. In the second run, young Austrian Katharina Gallhuber, whose best World Cup finish was a shared fifth place in the Stockholm city event almost a month before the Games, skied the race of her life, posting the best run time. This put her in the lead and when Haver-Løseth, Shiffrin and Swenn-Larsson all were not able to beat Gallhuber’s overall time, she was on the podium winning a surprising medal.
At the end it was bronze for her with Hansdotter winning gold and Holdener only 0.05 seconds behind taking silver, finishing in second place, as she did so often. Shiffrin missing the podium was one of the biggest upsets of the PyeongChang Olympics. Finishing in seventh place was Bernadette Schild, who had an incredible second run and led until the last intermediate time before she slipped just before the last flat part of the course and had to take some gates from the wrong side, which cost her speed.

The course was roughly the same as in 1896, measuring this time about 41,860 metres. The Greeks hoped to duplicate the finish of 1896, when Spyridon Louis had provided the home crowd with a Greek winner. In preparation, the Greeks held a trial race on 17 March 1906, from which they selected their Olympic marathoners. The race was won by Anastasios Koutoulakis, with Dimitrios Kantzias second. Although he had finished second, Kantzias was noted to be the Greek favorite.
The marathoners were transported to Marathon the day before the race (30 April [17 April]) and spent the night at the residence of Foreign Minister Skouzes. The route was staffed at one mile intervals with five soldiers, who were enlisted to provide medical supervision. Ambulances, military surgeons, nurses, and stretchers were available at five mile intervals. The route was kept clear by police, assisted by a battalion of infantry, two squadrons of cavalry, and one of gendermerie. The head timekeeper was a lieutenant of the cavalry who rode at the head of the pack, and changed his mount four times.
The 1906 Olympic marathon race started at 3:05 PM (1505) on 1 May [18 April], a very warm day (27° C. [81° F.]). The starter was G. Karamaliklis. The early lead was held by George Blake (AUS) and William  Frank (USA). At about 25 km., Billy Sherring of Canada passed both runners and dominated the remainder of the race, winning by almost seven minutes. As he passed within two miles of the stadium, a cannon was fired at the Rizarian School to notify the spectators in the Panathenaic Stadium.
When Sherring finished, the disappointment of the Greek crowd was almost palpable, but Prince George greeted him at the stadium entrance and, reminiscent of Louis and 1896, ran with him the entire way to the finish. Sherring finished the race carrying his shoes in his hands. Following Sherring was another foreigner, John Svanberg of Sweden, a well-known distance runner in his native country, who passed Frank near the stadium to finish second. Frank held on to get third place. Blake fell back to finish sixth.
One athlete who did not finish was the Italian, Dorando Pietri, who in 1908 would be involved in the most famous finish in Olympic marathon history when, near collapse, he was helped across the line by the British Olympic officials. He would be disqualified.
The Canadians had tried to send two marathoners, Sherring, and Jack Caffrey, who had twice beaten Sherring in the past year in Canadian distance races. But the proposal to raise money by a civic fund in Hamilton was vetoed by the City Council, and a public concert turned up only $75, not nearly enough for the trip for either man. Sherring was given the money and, on a tip from a bartender, William “Butch” Collier, bet it on a racehorse named Cicely, at six-to-one. Cicely won and Sherring had enough money to go to Athens. He went to Athens over two months early and trained continually on the road between Marathon and Athens. During his stay in Greece, he lost over 20 pounds from his voracious training. One newspaper report of his training noted, “Word was received here today that Sherring, the famous Hamilton sprinter, broke all records in a trial run over the Marathon course at Athens, and will go faster on the day of the race.”

A total of 24 teams qualified with each country allowed to enter a maximum of three teams. Nineteen quotas were assigned during the 2017 World Figure Skating Championships (Denmark returned their quota after it was discovered that one of their athletes did not have Danish citizenship, and there was no other eligible team). A further six quotas were given out at the 2017 CS Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany, which meant 48 athletes from 17 nations competed in PyeongChang.
Three-time World champions, Canada’s Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir had already won  three Olympic medals (2010 dance gold, 2014 dance silver, and 2014 team silver) by the time they arrived in PyeongChang. They had taken a break from the sport after the 2014 Sochi Olympics, and when they returned in time for the 2018 Olympic season, their Olympic free dance program “Moulin Rouge” was unveiled at the Canadian Championships, where they had received a perfect score of 124.70 points. By the time the individual ice dance competition started in PyeongChang, they had also captured a second Olympic gold medal in the team event. Not only were their main rivals their training partners, France’s Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, they also shared the coaches of Marie-France Dubreuil and Patrice Lauzon, which set up for an epic battle.
After the short program, the Canadians were in the lead scoring 83.67 points, breaking their own world record of 82.68, set in October 2017. The French were in second place, just 1.74 points behind Virtue and Moir, despite suffering a wardrobe malfunction. Americans Madison Hubbell and Zach Donohue were in third place, with their teammates, siblings Maia Shibutani and Alex Shibutani, in fourth, with just 0.02 points separating the two American couples.
Entering the free skate long program in almost a dead-heat with the French team, Virtue and Moir had decided that since they were skating last, they were going to skate “blind”, and would not watch or listen to anyone else’s score from ahead of them.  This meant that when they took to the ice, they did not know that their French training partners had set a combined world record 205.28 points, and were in the lead. When the Canadians received their own marks after their skate, they had no idea if their 122.40 points was enough to capture the gold medal – they hadn’t done the math and had to wait for the announcer to declare they had set a world record with a combined score of 206.07 points and had won. Papadakis and Cizeron finished with a total of 205.28 points to capture the silver medal. With their bronze medal, the Shibutani (nicknamed Shib Sibs) became USA’s first double medal-winner of the 2018 Games (having won bronze in the team event).
Virtue and Moir became the most decorated ice dancers in Olympic history at the 2018 Games, and tied with Gillis Grafström of Sweden, Sonja Henie of Norway and Russia’s Irina Rodnina, for having the most gold medals in Olympic figure skating history.

The American team was made up of military players stationed in the Far East, known as the Far East Command (FEC) All-Stars. The game was held on Saturday, 1 December, starting at 1210. The teams played only six innings with the American team winning, 11-5, having taken a 6-1 lead after three innings. The American starting pitcher, Vane Sutton greatly helped his cause when he also hit a grand slam home run in the third inning.
The game started out with 80,000 fans in attendance but had a final attendance of over 100,000, the largest ever to see a baseball game, although they were mostly there for the athletics events that were to follow the demonstration.
The US team played the Olympic demonstration as part of a tour of Australia running from 25 November to 18 December. They had played two games against a New South Wales side prior to the Olympics, and played another 10 after the Games. Some games were played against an Australian team, while others were against New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia teams. In all, the American team only lost one game, that to Australia on 5 December, 2-1.
This game has frustrated us somewhat as Olympic historians. Although we know some scoring details, no box score for the game has ever been found despite major efforts to locate one, so we are uncertain as to the details of who played in the game.

At the 1964 Worlds, Trentin had defeated his teammate, Daniel Morelon, in the final, with third-place going to Italy’s Sergio Bianchetto (ITA), who had won Olympic gold in 1960 in the tandem. Those three made the semi-finals, where they were joined by the surprising Italian, Giovanni Pettenella. Little known before the Tokyo Olympics, he had already earned a silver medal in the kilometer, behind Belgium’s Patrick Sercu. Sercu, the 1963 World Sprint Champion, competed in this event as well, but was defeated in two straight races in the quarters by Pettenella.
The first semi matched Trentin and Pettenella. Trentin won the first race, and looked to have won the second but was disqualified for interference. Pettenella won the rubber match to advance to the final. The other semi also went three races, with Bianchetto edging Morelon in the final race. The final was not close. Pettenella won comfortably, easing up in both races. Morelon won the bronze medal, after losing the first race to Trentin, by sweeping the final two races. It was the first of four consecutive medals that Morelon would win in this event, including two gold medals in 1968 and 1972. Pettenella was a true shooting star, with few palmares before or after the Tokyo Olympics. As a professional his only podium finish in the World Championships came in 1968, when he placed third in the sprint.

China, Japan and the United States joined the American-led boycott, and were replaced by Brazil, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The United States would have been a medal contender. The absent nations of China, Japan, Korea, and the United States comprised four of the top six places at the 1978 World Championships.
Cuba had won the World Championships in 1978, while the Soviet Union had won the last seven European Championships. Group A was a difficult one, with the Soviet Union and Cuba joined by East Germany, which had been runners-up at the last two Europeans. Cuba was the odd team out, with the USSR and GDR advancing to the semis, joined by Bulgaria and Hungary from Group B.

From then on the Britons were the team to beat in the race, winning World Championships in 2010 and 2011. The 2012 World Cup season was not their best, however, leaving the 2012 Olympic gold medal up for grabs and giving the Danes a chance for revenge, as all both teams from Beijing would be participating in London. Not to be counted out were Storm Uru and Peter Taylor of New Zealand, winners of the 2009 World Championships and silver medalists in 2011.
Denmark had the fastest time in the heats and the semi-finals, although Great Britain closed in on them somewhat in the latter round. The final did not get off to a good start for the British duo, however, as one of the seats on the boat broke once the race had begun. After a delay and some repairs, they were allowed to restart because the equipment failure had occurred within the first 100 meters. Their second start was much better, with Purchase and Hunter quickly taking a lead over the Danes. By the 1500m mark it looked as if Great Britain had clinched the gold medal, but Denmark unleashed a fantastic sprint in the final quarter and the teams went neck and neck right to the line, where Rasmussen and Quist were victorious by six tenths of a second.

But this time they had great expectations for their excellent ski jumping team. The team was composed of four experienced jumpers, all of whom had shown good form early in the season. The big star was undoubtedly 28-year old Yukio Kasaya. He had taken a silver medal in the Normal Hill at the 1970 World Championships behind double gold medalist Gari Napalkov of Soviet. In the Four Hill’s Tournament at the beginning of the Olympic season, Kasaya had won the first three competitions. After that the Japanese team returned home to Japan to prepare for their home Olympics. Kasaya would probably have won the overall combined tournament easily, instead the Norwegian Ingolf Mork was the overall winner due to Kasaya’s absence in the fourth competition. Also the fact that all jumpers of the Japanese team came from Hokkaido made the local interest for the Normal Hill competition, three days after the opening of the Games, enormous.
After the first round the Japanese audience went wild: The Japanese quartet held the first four positions! Kasaya made a perfect jump of 84.0 m, the longest of the day, but was closely followed by Seiji Aochi, who jumped 83.5 m. In third place was Akitsugu Konno from Sapporo, followed by the fourth Japanese, Takashi Fujisawa, the silver medalist in the Large Hill from the World Championships in Oslo six years earlier. Best of the non-Japanese jumpers was the Swede Rolf Nordgren followed by another surprise man, the 19-year old Pole Wojciech  Fortuna.
The Japanese team was under great pressure from the home crowd before the start of the second round. Kasaya kept cool, had the best jump of all in the second round and won by a margin of almost 10 points. Konno made the second best jump of the second round and advanced to silver, and Aochi secured a clean medal sweep for Japan, the first in ski jumping since the Norwegian team made it in 1948. Only Fujisawa could not repeat his first jump, he missed totally and fell down from fourth to 23rd in the final ranking. Mork advanced from 14th after the first round, being the best non-Japanese in fourth place, and defending Olympic Champion Jiří Raška climbed from 13th to a final fifth place. Fortuna kept his sixth place from the first round, and the double World 1970 Champion Napalkov had to be content with a seventh place.
Kasaya and his teammates were celebrated as national heroes, Japan having avenged the disappointing results from their male speed skating sprinters in the 500 m from the day before.

But on the sixth dive, Kalinina’s teammate, the completely unknown Yelena Vaytsekhovskaya nailed her back 2½ pike and moved into the lead. She was never headed and won a very surprise gold medal.

He had been the 2019 European Champion, however, and won a silver medal at the 2020 Europeans. The last three World Cups had been won by Max Salminen (SWE/2017), Zsombor Berecz (HUN/2018), and Josh Junior (NZL/2019), who had all competed at Rio de Janeiro in 2016, but none of them had made the podium.
The first two races were won by Turkish sailor Alican Kaynar, with the podium identical as Berecz finished second and Spain’s Joan Cardona was third in both phases. Scott was ninth in both the races and stood ninth entering the third race. He then reeled off three straight victories, but still stood only second behind Cardona, as Kaynar dropped back and was never again a factor in the medal race. Scott also won the sixth race to finally move into the lead. After Junior won the seventh phase, Scott won races eight and nine to separate himself from the field, but the gold medal was still in play entering the medal race, with Berecz second and Cardona third. Berecz won the medal race, with Scott fourth, but it was enough to bring Scott the gold medal as Berecz took silver and Cardona won bronze.
The Finn World Cup was held later in the summer and was won by New Zealand’s Andy Maloney, who had not competed at Tokyo, as New Zealand was represented by Junior. At that event Cardona took silver and Junior claimed the bronze.
The Finn class, a heavyweight single-handed dinghy, had been contested at the Olympics since 1952 when Danish legend Paul Elvstrøm won the second of his four consecutive gold medals in single-handed sailing. But the Tokyo Games would be the last appearance for the Finn class at the Olympics, as it was eliminated from the programme for the Paris 2024 Olympics, in favor of a mixed two-handed class for complete gender equity of the Olympic sailing programme. For Scott, his second consecutive gold medal was the first time anyone had defended in the Finn class since Elvstrøm.

The 10-race opening series decided the gold and silver medals as the Australians opened a 28-point lead on New Zealand’s Peter Burling and Blair Tuke, who were in turn 32 points ahead of the rest of the field. The only suspense was for the bronze medal, which seemed to be set for Denmark, who were third after the opening series. The medal race was held on the Nothe course in light and shifty nine-knot winds, and Austria’s Nico Delle Karth and Niko Resch, who were only seventh entering the final race, dominated through the early sections and appeared set to move up to the bronze medal. But Danes Allan Nørregaard and Peter Lang, only seventh after four legs, steered hard left on the final upwind leg to pass Australia and moved back into the bronze medal position. Australia’s victory was their third sailing gold medal of the London Olympics. One other minor change in this class was that it was raced as a men-only event after being a mixed class in 2000-08.

Few would have considered Zimbabwe’s Kirsty Coventry a medal favourite before the Games began but the American-based swimmer had already won a silver and a bronze and this event was potentially a stronger one for her. Coventry took the lead from the first few strokes and left Komarova trailing in her wake to claim Zimbabwe’s first individual Olympic gold and the first by any African swimmer from outside South Africa. Komarova held on for silver with Reiko Nakamura of Japan and Germany’s Antje Buschschulte finishing in a dead heat for third.
Coventry’s win came at the time when racial tensions in Zimbabwe were at a peak and, for a short time at least, brought the troubled country some measure of joy.

He competed for Georgia in 1996. He did not compete in 2000 but would represent the United States in 2004. The 1999 World Champion was Hungary’s Zsuzsanna Vőrős, who struggled throughout. She finished only 15th in the opening shooting, was 17th after fencing, and while she won the 200 freestyle swim, she would finish only 15th overall.

The 1980 Olympic relay became a rather non-exciting affair, with almost no changing of positions among the best teams after the first leg.
At the first leg, four teams left the others early: East Germany, the Soviet Union, Norway and Sweden, and at the last part of the leg, East Germany’s Marlies Rostock and Soviet Nina Baldycheva went away, Rostock reaching the exchange two seconds ahead of Baldycheva, with Norway in third 18 seconds behind the leader. On the second leg East Germany’s Carola Anding went away from the Soviet Union’s Nina Rocheva and built up almost a 30 second lead at the exchange. Norway was still in third, 35 seconds behind the leader. On the third leg Veronika Hesse decided the relay in East Germany’s favor by outclassing Galina Kulakova, and when Olympic 10 km champion Barbara Petzold took over on the anchor leg, the margin ahead of the Soviet team was nearly one minute, with Norway still in third place. Petzold cruised to the finish for an easy win, 1:05 ahead of Soviet’s Raisa Smetanina, and Norway’s Berit Aunli was another minute behind in third place. Finland was a distant and disappointing fifth behind Czechoslovakia, after lying sixth most of the race. Their anchor leg skier Hilkka Riihivouri overtook Sweden in the final part of the race.

Germany followed in second place for silver, with Katherine Sauerbrey, Katharina Hennig, Victoria Carl, and Sofie Krehl. It was Germany’ third silver in the event after 2006 and 2010, and their first Olympic cross-country skiing medal since relay bronze at Sochi in 2014.
ROC and Germany pulled away from the field early on. Stupak made the first attempt to break, but Sauerbrey ran an incredibly strong second lap and was able to catch up at the first exchange. She wasn’t even part of the World Cup team at the beginning of the season.
Hennig and Nepryayeva were able to keep up the pace, and distance themselves more and more from the other teams. On the penultimate climb, Nepryayeva was able to pull away a little before the next exchange. In the first chasing group were favorites Sweden, with Ebba Andersson, and Norway, with Therese Johaug. Norway had a slight problem after their first runner Tiril Udnes Weng fell, but Johaug pushed Norway into third place, 22.8 seconds behind Victoria Carl.
Carl initially had to let Tatyana Sorina past, but she fought back, as the Russian couldn’t maintain the high pace from the beginning. Carl handed over to Krehl in first place for Germany. The lead over Russia was five seconds, but behind them Norway and Finland, around 15 seconds back, were putting on the pressure.
Krehl, leading at the start of the final leg, could not shake off the Russian sprint specialist Stepanova, who pulled away on the penultimate climb to anchor ROC to a stunning gold. Sweden and Finland came a little bit closer from behind, but Krehl was able to save a small lead of 5.2 seconds to the finish holding off the fast-finishing Jonna Sundling, and Krista Pärmäkoski.
Sweden looked destined to miss out on the medals for most of the race, especially after a disappointing third leg from Frida Karlsson, which saw them slip from third to fifth. However, a strong finish saw Sundling edge out Pärmäkoski in a dramatic final sprint for bronze. Defending champion Norway was shut out of the medals, finishing a disappointing fifth.

The podium positions were also identical as Adam Małysz won silver and Gregor Schlierenzauer improved his position in the second round to claim the bronze medal.
Prior to the competition, Austria’s head coach Alexander Pointner accused the Swiss of using curved iron bindings, which were not approved by the International Ski Federation (FIS). According to Pointner, the bindings enabled Ammann to gain a better flight position, thereby improving aerodynamics. The FIS said, however, that Ammann’s bindings were in line with the rules
With four Olympic golds, Ammann matched Matti Nykänen’s record number of Olympic ski jumping titles.

The Kenyan team was so strong that they had swept the medals at Daegu, and third-place finisher Sharon Cherop was not even selected for the Olympic team.
The race started slowly in the rain, and at the halfway point 28 runners remained together. At 25 km Kiplagat made the first serious attack, dropping all but her teammates and the three Ethiopians, led by Tiki Gelana, who had won the Rotterdam Marathon in April in 2-18:58 and won at Amsterdam in October 2011. Russian Tatyana Arkhipova bridged to the leaders at 32 km, and by 35 km, only four were left in the main pack to contest the medals – Keitany, Jeptoo, Gelana, and Arkhipova. Keitany attempted a surge on The Embankment, similar to the one that had won her the London Marathon, but nobody budged. The four went through 40 km together and Gelana then attacked, with only Jeptoo able to respond. Gelana quickly opened about 20 metres on Jeptoo but that margin stayed intact through the finish line, as Jeptoo could not close, and Gelana could not open further, winning the gold medal by five seconds. Behind them Keitany was spent and would drop to fourth, as Arkhipova won bronze.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
With re-testing, six athletes would later be disqualified in this event, although the medalists were not implicated. The highest finisher to be DQed was Ukrainian Tetiana Hamera-Shmyrko, who originally finished fifth. Also disqualified were China’s Wang Jiali (58th), two athletes from Turkey – Bahar Doğan (62nd) and Ümmü Kiraz (88th), and two athletes who did not finish – Colombian Yolanda Caballero and Russian Liliya Shobukhova.

Ledecky took the lead early, splitting 57.67 at 100 metres and holding the lead through almost 350 metres.

Ledecky could not respond as Titmus increased her lead to win gold in 3:56.69, as Ledecky finished in 3:57.36. Titmus’s time was the second fastest ever, and Ledecky swam her second fastest 400 in finishing second.
Immediately the discussion began of the legendary status of the race, many swim experts calling it the greatest ever women’s Olympic race. Few argued with that. Almost as notable as Titmus was her coach, Dean Boxall, who went into a wild celebration of fist-pumping, arm waving, and screaming up in the stands.
Titmus and Ledecky were more restrained and spoke admirably of each other, Titmus noting, “I wouldn’t be here without her. She’s set this standard for middle-distance freestyle. If I didn’t have someone like her to chase, I definitely wouldn’t be swimming the way I am.”
Ledecky handled the defeat with class, “It can’t get much better than that. It was tremendous racing, a lot of fun and I can’t be too disappointed with that. That was my second-best swim ever and I feel like I fought tooth and nail and that’s all you can ask for.”

Far more important to the outcome of the medals was the lack of international competition since 2019 and the sheer luck of the draw. The top seeded Frenchman Sofiane Oumiha had the misfortune to be drawn against Keyshawn Davis for his first bout. Davis had seemingly given up on his Olympic ambitions by signing a contract to box professionally, but the COVID-19 pandemic gave him an unexpected reprieve.
Davis had won three pro bouts when it became apparent that both the Pan-American and final world qualifying events would not take place and Pan-American qualification for Tokyo would be via the world rankings. As the only American eligible via those rankings, Davis was asked to take the US Olympic team spot and performed well in Japan. After a win over Enrico Lacruz he took out Oumiha in the second round of their bout, then completed his rout of Europeans with wins over two other highly rated fighters in Gabil Mamedov and Hovhannes Bachkov.
Over on the other side of the draw something similar was happening via the fists of Cuban Andy Cruz. Ranked in a lowly position due to a lack of competition, the two-time world champion reached the final with three comfortable wins.
The gold medal bout was a throwback to the great Cuba-USA rivalries of the last quarter of the 20th century. Cruz and Davis shared the first two rounds so the title came down to the three final minutes. One of the judges believed Davis had done enough to win but the other four came down in favour of the Cuban fighter, which earned Cruz the gold medal.
The traditional award for the best boxer of the Games, the Val Barker Trophy, was not awarded in 2021 due to the AIBA not being involved in running the Olympic tournament, but Cruz won an award bearing the same name that was given out at the 2021 AIBA men’s World Championships later in the year.

She was favored but was expecting a big challenge from her long-time rival, German Isabell Werth, individually the champion at Atlanta in 1996, a three-time World and five-time European champion. In Beijing Werth led after the Grand Prix round, and the Grand Prix Special round, with van Grunsven second in both phases. However, in the Grand Prix Freestyle, done to music, or the so-called kür, van Grunsven had the highest score in both artistic and technical components to win that phase and win her third consecutive gold medal, with Werth taking silver. German Heike Kemmer won bronze.
In the Grand Prix round Japan’s Hiroshi Hoketsu finished in a tie for 34th, and did not advance to the second round (only the top 25 did). This was his second Olympics, after competing at Tokyo in 1964, fully 44 years before Beijing. Hoketsu’s gap of 44 years between Olympic appearances was far more than the previous record of 32 years set by Mexican Eduardo Prieto, who competed in fencing in 1932 and sailing in 1964, and the mark of 28 years in the same sport, held by six Olympians. Hoketsu would compete again in 2012, when he was 71-years-old.

The final quickly turned into a duel between Taris and Crabbe with the three Japanese finalists fighting for the bronze medal. The Frenchman pulled out to an early lead and was two lengths ahead of his rival at the halfway stage, but Crabbe came back at him, drew level and, as the excited crowd roared their local boy onwards, passed Taris to touch first.

As such it seemed an obvious prediction that two time World Champion Tatjana Hüfner and compatriots Natalie Geisenberger and Anke Wischnewski would be the sliders to beat in Vancouver. The main threat to German victory came from a pair of North Americans. In February 2009 American Erin Hamlin had broken the 15-year run of German victories in major global championships by becoming the first World Champion from the USA whilst Alex Gough of Canada, 8th in the 2009-10 World Cup, had more experience on the track conditions than any other slider.
Following the tragic death of Nodar Kumaritashvili in practice it was decided that the women’s course would be over a shorter distance than originally planned, namely the junior course. This brought criticism particularly by the Canadian team, that some thought a little tactless considering the circumstances, that the contest would be turned into a lottery.
While this change was thought to favour those lugers with a more powerful start this proved only partially to be the case.  The angle of the start, designed for junior races, was not designed for the power of the senior races.  The racers had to make a compromise between the need to carry the speed of a powerful start and the necessity to negotiate a difficult corner without being forced up high onto the ice wall and losing all the advantage gained.
The Germans Tatjana Hüfner and Natalie Geisenberger were favoured to take the first two medals but, rather surprisingly Nina Reithmayer (AUT) led after the first run in a track record time of 41.728 seconds. However Hüfner clawed her way back to take the lead after the second run and retained her lead for the rest of the competition to take the gold medal with the fastest runs in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th runs. Reithmayer managed to hold on to the silver medal place ahead of Geisenberger who, despite having only the 7th best time on the final run, held on to take the bronze from fast finishing Tatyana Ivanova (RUS). World champion Erin Hamlin failed to cope with the changes to the circuit and placed a lowly 16th as European athletes took the first 14 places in the finishing order.
The safety of the competitors was paramount after the tragic death of Nodar Kumaritashvili on a training run but the women’s event was not entirely free of injury. Violeta Strămăturaru of Romania was knocked unconscious during a training run and the ensuing concussion forced her to withdraw from the Games.

The defending Olympic champions, China, were also a threat, having won bronze at the last two World Championships, as were the Russians, 2010 World Champions and 2011 runners-up. The Romanian team, Olympic champions from 2000 and 2004, were another potential challenger, completing a foursome of squads that were in a class of their own in Olympic competition. In fact, if the 1992 Unified Team and the Soviet Union are considered precursors to the Russian team, then these four nations had won the event in every edition of the Olympic Games since 1948, when Czechoslovakia had taken the gold before the Soviet Union began competing at the Olympics.
The qualification round went as expected, with the United States, Russia, China, and Romania placing first through fourth. Rounding out the bottom half were Great Britain, Japan, Italy, and Canada, but they were not expected to challenge the front runners. The United States took an early lead in the finals and never relinquished it, winning gold for the first time since 1996.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"The reigning World Champion in men’s heavyweight Greco-Roman wrestling, and a favorite for gold at the London Olympics, was Elis Guri, who had first participated in the Olympics in 2008 as a competitor for his native Albania. Thereafter he was absent from major competitions for three years as he switched allegiances to Bulgaria and made his return by winning a bronze medal at the 2011 European Championships prior to his victory at the World Championships. He faced challenges from several wrestlers in his quest for Olympic glory, most notably Jimmy Lidberg of Sweden, who was twice runner-up (2009 and 2011) and once a bronze medalist (2010) at the World Championships.
Guri and Lidberg were drawn into the same half, setting up a potentially exciting semi-final match, but it was not to be: both wrestlers were eliminated in the quarterfinals. Guri was defeated by Timofey Deynichenko of Belarus, runner-up at the 2010 European and World Championships, while Lindberg was bested by 2011 World Championship bronze medalist Rustam Totrov of Russia. Totrov then conquered Deynichenko in the semifinals, eliminating any chance of Guri winning a medal. In the final the Russian met Ghasem Rezaei of Iran, a two-time Asian Champion (2007 and 2008) whose best finish at the World Championships was third in 2007.The first round went to par terre where, although Totrov almost managed to rise from the bottom position, he was taken down at the last moment by Rezaei and scored upon. The second period again went to par terre, despite the best efforts of the Russian, who was unable to convert his top advantage to a point, even with a fantastic push that tossed both competitors out of the ring simultaneously (and therefore scored no points). Thus Iran, which had begun the 2012 Olympics with zero Greco-Roman gold medals to its name, left the tournament with three, following earlier victories by Hamid Soryan and Omid Noroozi in the featherweight and lightweight categories respectively.
Lidberg and Deynichenko, meanwhile, met up in a bronze medal bout, where Deynichenko took an early lead by reversing the Swede’s advantage in the first par terre and scoring two points in the dying seconds of the period. Lidberg struck back in the next two rounds, however, starting with a successful defense in the second par terre that forced a third, decisive period. This round too went to par terre, but the Swede had fewer cautions and was therefore granted the top advantage, using it to score four points to Deynichenko’s one in the final twenty-two seconds of the match and clinch the bronze. The final podium spot was decided between Yunior Estrada of Cuba and Artur Aleksanyan of Armenia, the 2012 European Champion and 2011 runner-up. For many years, including an appearance at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Estrada was a light-heavyweight wrestler and had won bronze in this division at the 2007 Pan American Games. He had switched to heavyweight by 2010, however, and won gold at the 2011 Pan American Games. In the bronze medal bout, Aleksanyan was dominant: he converted his top advantage in the round one par terre to two points and then pushed Estrada out of the ring in the second period to claim victory.

The United States had the second-best set of sprinters, but they were no match for the Jamaicans.
In the first heat Great Britain surprisingly finished first, ahead of the United States with Jamaica third, although they did not run their first squad. Britain was aided by the return of Dina Asher-Smith, who had injured her hamstring in the 100 and did not run the 200, in which she was favored. Germany won the second heat.
The final was close throughout, as Briana Williams started off for Jamaica, and handed off to Thompson-Herah, but they had no significant advantage over the USA, who opened with Javianne Oliver and Teahna Daniels. On the third leg Fraser-Pryce took over but could not gain ground on the turn against Jenna Prandini, primarily a 200 runner. The Jamaicans really only took the lead when Prandini and US anchor Gabrielle Thomas had a slightly rough exchange. That gave Jackson the gap she needed, and Jamaica won gold in 41.02, with the United States taking silver in 41.45. Great Britain anchor Daryll Neita closed quickly to bring them home for the bronze.
For Thompson-Herah this completed her sprint triple, after winning the 100 and 200 in Tokyo, making her only the fifth woman to win gold in the three sprint events – after Fanny Blankers-Koen (NED-1948), Betty Cuthbert (AUS-1956), Wilma Rudolph (USA-1960), and Florence Griffith Joyner (USA-1988).

The four crews, were separated by just three points and after the medal race one of them would go home without a medal. The leading teams confirmed their superiority by placing 1, 2, 4 and 7 in the medal race. But it was Spain, who had the best score after the preliminaries, that placed seventh and last of the four contenders, and their 14 points dropped them from first to fourth place. With a fourth place finish and eight more points, Denmark snatched the bronze medal from Spain. But the stars of the extremely close final were Brazil and New Zealand. Separated by just one point going in to the final race, it meant that whichever team finished ahead of the other would win gold. Eventually, Grael and Kunze, the 2014 world champions and 2015 runners-up, edged out the other former world champions Meech and Maloney by just two points after beating the New Zealanders into second place. After the finish, family members and friends of the victors waded into the water and carried the boat to the shore with the sailors standing on top.

Crouser had not won the 2019 World Championship, losing by a centimetre to his teammate Joe Kovacs, but he had since re-written the all-time performance list. He had broken the world record with 23.37 at the US Olympic Trials and had multiple throws over 75 feet (22.86). The three medallists were back with Kovacs and New Zealander Tom Walsh still expected to challenge for medals.
In round one of the final Crouser took the lead with an Olympic record 22.83, the #13 performance of all-time. He extended that lead in round two with 22.93, the #4 performance ever. He continued his amazing series, bettering the pre-Tokyo Olympic record with all six throws, and finally, in round six, tossing 23.30, a mark bettered only by his own world record. His average throw in the finals was 22.87, a mark surpassed by only four other throwers.
Behind Crouser, Kovacs and Walsh contested the other medals, as the other competitors were basically a sideshow. Kovacs threw 22.19 in round one to stand second, while in round four he would improve to 22.65, with Walsh in third at 22.17. Walsh improved in round five with 22.18, but still stood third. In the final round Walsh threw 22.47 to solidify bronze while Kovacs threw 22.60, not enough to improve but a significant throw, and he would win silver.
In the end the podium was as expected – Crouser gold, Kovacs silver, Walsh bronze – which was the exact same podium as at Rio de Janeiro in 2016. After 125 years of modern Olympic Games, that marked the first time in Olympic history that an individual podium in any sport or event had been exactly the same at two consecutive Olympic Games.

The next day the women ran the 400 hurdles final, and nobody expected anything to match the men’s race. They would be wrong.
The two favorites were the Americans Sydney McLaughlin and Dalilah Muhammad. Muhammad was the defending gold medallist, and had won the 2019 World Championship, in which she set the world record of 52.16, as McLaughlin finished second. McLaughlin was younger, and had competed at Rio, where she was barely 17-years-old, failing to make the final. At the US Olympic Trials in July, McLaughlin finally defeated Muhammad, running a world record of 51.90. A third runner, Dutchwoman Femke Bol, had also had an outstanding summer, but she was only expected to challenge for the bronze medal.
Everybody made the final as expected, with Muhammad, McLaughlin, and Bol winning the three semi-finals. Muhammad got off to the fastest start and led to the eighth hurdle, with McLaughlin and Bol about a step behind and almost together. As they approached the last barrier, McLaughlin had almost caught Muhammad, who had a slight stutter step before clearing.
On the run-in McLaughlin was the strongest, crossing the line in 51.46 to break the world record by almost ½-a-second. Muhammad was also well under the world mark, finishing in 51.58 for silver as Bol crossed in 52.03, a European record and a mark that would have been a world record until two months before the Games. The entire field was fast, as the first six finishers bettered 54 seconds, the first time that had ever happened in a women’s 400 hurdle race.

In 2008-09, she won the World Championships, Skate America, and the Four Continents, while in the 2009-10 season she had already won Skate America and the Grand Prix Final coming into Vancouver. In the short program, she opened well, taking a comfortable lead over Japan’s Mao Asada. Two nights later, in the free skate, her performance was the stuff of legend, as she scored 150.06 for a total of 228.56, both world best marks for women in the new scoring system – the previous bests were 133.95 and 210.03 by Kim at the 2009 French Grand Prix. This gave her a huge victory over Asada, who held on for the silver medal, leading her by 23.06 points. Kim was coached by Brian Orser, the 1988 men’s silver medalist.
The bronze medal was won by Canadian Joannie Rochette, but on this day, it shone as brilliantly in the Vancouver sun as any gold medal. Rochette had been runner-up to Kim at the 2009 World Championships and was a six-time Canadian champion, having twice won the Trophée Éric Bombard. A native of a small-town in Québec, on Saturday, only days before the short program, her mother and father flew to Vancouver to watch their daughter compete in the Olympics. On arrival at the airport, Thérèse Rochette developed chest pains and was rushed to a Vancouver hospital where she died soon thereafter from the effects of a massive heart attack. Joannie was scheduled to compete in the short program on Tuesday but it was not certain if she would compete. She elected to skate, honoring her mother, and she placed third in the short with a solid program with no significant flaws. On the night of the free skate, her father, Normand Rochette, watched from the stands as his daughter skated beautifully. She had one small stumble coming out of a combination jump, but she held up both physically and emotionally, to mount the podium in her mother’s memory, the first time a Canadian had won an Olympic medal in the ladies’ singles since Elizabeth Manley in Calgary in 1988.

Lewis and Kaden were the first big names to meet and Lewis, the British-born Canadian, sensationally dispatched his more experienced East German opponent in just thirty-four seconds. Bowe and Miroshnichenko met in the semi-finals with the American taking victory on points. This meant Lewis and Bowe would face other for the Olympic championship. Bowe held the upper hand in the first round and won it quite comfortably but, urged to be more aggressive by the corner, Lewis took control in the second round and forced his opponent to take two standing counts. After the second count, the referee sent Bowe back to his corner and, to the shock of many in the arena, waved the bout off.
The two finalists turned professional and for the next decade their careers ran parallel with each other.  Both men had reigns as world heavyweight champion though Lewis’s time at the top of his profession was much longer than Bowe’s. In 2004 Lewis retired whilst still heavyweight champion, a feat not done for over 50 years. In contrast Bowe’s life began to fall apart and in 2000 he was sent to jail for 17 months for kidnapping his wife and children at knifepoint. In court his attorneys claimed in mitigation that he had suffered brain damage during his career but incredibly he was still allowed to resume his boxing career in 2004. He fought three low key fights before retiring for good.

The couple moved to Helsinki and Ludowika got Finnish citizenship during the war. Their strongest opponents looked to be the Austrian couple Helene Engelmann/Alfred Berger. Coming from a real figure skating dynasty in Vienna, she had won the World Championships together with Karl Mejstrik as early as in 1913. With a new partner, Alfred Berger, she won the first post-war championships 1922, defeating the Jakobssons clearly.
In Chamonix, Engelmann/Berger were Olympic champions with a clear margin to the Jakobsson couple. Bronze medalists were a young couple from France, Andrée Joly (22) and Pierre Brunet (21). They would later make an important impact on Olympic pair skating. Engelmann/Berger ended their skating career by winning their second World title in Manchester four weeks after the Olympics.

This change in the program was certainly a much better solution for those skiers competing in both events.
The 18 km. race presented a strong field of merited skiers, all of them at their competitive peak. In Norway’s team Johan Grøttumsbraaten, the defending champion now aged 32, had shown new proof of his championship abilities by winning the World Championships at 18 km. in Oberhof, Germany 1931. Arne Rustadstuen was world champion on the distance in 1930, and Ole Stenen was World Champion in 50 km. from 1931 and had won the prestigious Holmenkollen the same year. Finland’s top skiers were Veli Saarinen, world champion at 18 km. in 1929 and Martti Lappalainen, winner in Holmenkollen 1928. Sweden’s Sven Utterström, now 30, had much cause for revenge after being ill during the 1928 Games. He was considered to be a 50 km. specialist, winning the World Championship 1930 and Holmenkollen in 1929 and 1930 over that distance.
The evening before the start of the race the weather was perfect for cross country skiing. But the next morning the temperature was rising, and that created problems preparing the skis for optimal gliding. In earlier competitions with mild weather the Swedes had shown great ability to choose the right ski-wax, and so they did this time. At an early stage of the race it was clear that this would be a great day for Sweden. Utterström commanded the race from start to finish, and won by a margin of exactly 2 minutes. The 24-year old Swede Axel Wikström surprised the experts by winning the silver medal 17 seconds ahead of Saarinen in 3rd place. Lappalainen was 4th, and the favored Norwegians were not satisfied with 5th and 6th place for Rustadstuen and Grøttumsbraaten, four minutes behind the winner.

Balzer had recently won the 1971 Europeans and Kilborn the 1970 Commonwealth Games, defeating 1968 champion Maureen Caird in the process. Caird competed in München but did not get out of round one.

The day after Majlinda Kelmendi won the first gold medal for Kosovo, the young country torn by ethnic rivalries, Rafaela Silva finally gained host country Brazil’s first gold medal, in the 57 kg class. But the main story behind Silva were her origins in the notorious favela (slum) Cidade de Deus (City of God) in Rio. It was there that the 2004 Olympic bronze medalist Flávio Canto founded a martial arts school which was to turn Silva into the world’s top judoka in her class. The 24-year-old was not really a surprise victor as she was the 2013 World Champion and a two-time gold medalist at the Pan American Games. However, prior to the Olympics she had dropped to 14 in the rankings. Silva had competed in London 2012 where she was disqualified for an illegal leg grab against Hedvig Karakas of Hungary. In Rio the two met again in the quarter-finals. This time, Silva scored a Waza-ari (half point) after 1:50 min, which proved to be sufficient to advance to the semi-final. After beating the second seed, Korean Kim Jan-Di, earlier in the tournament, in the final Silva faced the top-seeded Asian Champion Dorjsurengiin Sumiya. Again, an early Waza-ari for a Sumi-otoshi (corner drop) was decisive in winning gold.
Bronze medals went to Telma Monteiro of Portugal, a five-time European Champion, and Kaori Matsumoto of Japan, the reigning Olympic and World Champion. Both were defeated by Sumiya in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively, of the elimination round.

That distinction went to Iran’s Omid Noroozi, the reigning World Champion, and Azerbaijan’s Həsən Əliyev, the 2010 World Champion, both of whom entered as the favorites in the competition. There were several strong competitors able to challenge for the bronze medals, but most observers foresaw Norouzi and Aliyev battling in the final, as they had ended up in opposite halves of the draw.
Norouzi struggled slightly with China’s Sheng Jiang in the opening round, but moved on and quickly asserted his dominance on his way to the final. Əliyev survived to the semi-finals, defeating Jeong along the way, but was eliminated at this stage by Revaz Lashkhi of Georgia, the 2011 European Champion. In the final, Norouzi was the better wrestler in each round, successfully defending the first par terre and then controlling the second round to score a single point that earned him the gold medal. It was Iran’s second Olympic title in Greco-Roman wrestling, the first having come only one day earlier with Hamid Soryan’s victory in the featherweight division.
In the first bronze medal match Əliyev was unable to defend against an onslaught from Zaur Kuramagomedov of Russia, a 2011 World Championship bronze medalist. Converting two rounds of par terre wrestling into points, Kuramagomedov was able to keep the former World Champion Azerbaijani off the podium. The contest for the second bronze medal was fought between Almat Kebispayev of Kazakhstan, runner-up at the 2011 World Championships and bronze medalist at the 2010 edition, and Ryutaro Matsumoto of Japan, silver medalist at the 2010 World Championships. The two were evenly matched and ferocious, each winning a round, before Matsumoto was able to get the best of his opponent and pin him, winning the bronze medal with the only fall of the event.

After entering the 2008 Olympic Games as the favorite in the division, and then ending up with only a bronze medal, Kudukhov switched to the lightweight division and grew even more successful, winning the three World Championships and again earning a reputation as a favorite, this time for the London Games. Strong challenges, however, were possible from Yogeshwar Dutt of India, the reigning Asian and Commonwealth Champion and an Olympic veteran from 2004 and 2008, Toğrul Əsgərov of Azerbaijan, the reigning European Champion and 2010 World runner-up, and Franklin Gómez of Puerto Rico, the reigning Pan American Champion and runner-up in the most recent World Championships.
In the end it was Kudukhov and Əsgərov who met in the final, with the latter having the easier time advancing through his bracket. The Russian, however, arguably had the stronger opponents, having to get through Gómez, Dutt, and Iran’s Masoud Esmaeilpoor, the 2010 Asian Champion and 2012 runner-up, on his way to the gold medal match. In the final, however, it was Əsgərov who was surprisingly dominant, winning the first round with a single point and scoring three points in the first fifteen seconds of the second period. An extra two points by the end were superfluous, as the Azerbaijani unseated the World Champion and earned the Olympic crown.
The first bronze medal match was contested by Kenichi Yumoto of Japan, a bronze medalist at both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the most recent World Championships, and Coleman Scott of the United States, a rookie on the international scene. The pair were evenly matched at first, leading the first round to a par terre in which Yumoto drew the advantage and was able to convert it into a point. In the second period Scott reversed a leg hold to score two points on his opponent, which rose to three following an unsuccessful challenge from the Japanese coaches. Yumoto then scored the first point in the final round, but Scott came back in the final fifteen seconds to score three points and take the medal. For the final podium spot, it was Dutt against Ri Jong-Myong of North Korea, whose best international finish was third at the 2011 Asian Championships. Both competitors looked strong at first, with Ri and Dutt winning the first and second rounds respectively by one point. By the end of the final period, however, Dutt had scored six unanswered points against Ri, clinching the bronze.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the events affected, in a sense.
In December 2013, Russian silver medalist Besik Kudukhov was killed in a car accident after colliding with a truck. In October 2016, his samples from the 2012 London Olympics were re-tested and came back positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone). Because he was deceased, and had no chance for an appeal, no change in the result standings, nor the medals, was made.

Wladár’s win was a bit of an upset, but in 1981, after winning both backstroke events at the European Championships, he would be named European Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World magazine and was Hungarian Sportsman of the Year. Bronze medalist Mark Kerry (AUS) had won gold in the 100 back at the 1979 Universiade, and had made the finals both backstrokes at the 1976 Olympics, placing fifth in this event.

However, nations were now limited to only two gymnasts in the finals. Nadia Comăneci was perfect in this event, quite literally. She scored a 20.00 in the team qualifying, with 10.00 for both he compulsory and optional routines, and then received another 10.00 in the final round, for a score of 20.00 in this event. At the modern Games (post-WW2), the only other times this happened on the 20-point scoring system was by Japan’s Shinji Morisue in 1984 on high bar, and Romania’s Daniela Silivaş in 1988 on the uneven bars. Comăneci was followed by her teammate, Teodora Ungureanu, and Hungarian Márta Egervári. This was the only women’s event in Montréal in which the Soviet Union did not win a medal. In fact, this was the only time between 1952-88, during the Olympic existence of the Soviet Union, in which they did win a medal in a women’s gymnastics event, save for the obvious 1984 boycott year.

Germany’s Nicole Reinhardt was the reigning World Champion, having also carried the title in 2005, and had eight World Championship victories in various disciplines, as well as a gold medal from the K-4 500 event at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Reinhardt was injured before the London Games, however, and replaced by Katrin Wagner-Augustin, who had four Olympic and ten World Championship titles. Although these were mostly in K-4 events, she had been the Olympic bronze medalist in the K-1 500 four years earlier and was the reigning European Champion in the event. The traditionally strong Hungarian team had Danuta Kozák, who had five World Championship titles in K-2 and K-4 events, as well as silver from the K-4 500 event in Beijing, and had also won the K-1 500 at the 2011 European Championships.
Of all the kayakers, however, none were more heralded than Josefa Idem-Guerrini. At 47-years-old, Idem-Guerrini had first participated in the Olympic Games in 1984 when, competing for West Germany, she won a bronze medal in the K-2 500. In the K-1 500 she had an Olympic gold medal from 2000, in addition to silver from 2004 and 2008 and bronze from 1996, as well as 22 medals from the World Championship, five of which were gold and two of which (1990 and 2001) were from the K-1 500. In qualifying for the 2012 Summer Olympics, she became the first woman to compete at eight Olympics (in any sport), a continuous string from 1984.
The unpredictable nature of the event was evident right from beginning, as several of the less heralded kayakers finished quicker than the favorites, with Sofia Paldanius of Sweden posting the fastest time overall. Kozák earned the best time in the semi-finals, but Wagner-Augustin was surprisingly eliminated, ending her ability to continue the German dominance in canoeing at the 2012 Games. In the final, Osypenko-Radomska got off to a strong start and led for most of the race, but her strength began wane in the last stretch of the course. She was overtaken by Kozák, who won the gold medal handily, but still managed to earn silver after staving off Bridgitte Hartley of South Africa, who won the bronze. Hartley, whose only major international medal was bronze in the K-1 1000 at the 2009 World Championships, gave South Africa its first ever Olympic medal in canoeing; their previous best results had been seventh, earned by Ruth Nortje in the K-1 500 in 2000 and the women’s K-4 500 team in 2008. Idem-Guerrini finished fifth in her eighth and final Olympics, certainly not the result she had hoped for, but her longevity was an unparalleled accomplishment overall.

The East Germans were also the reigning European and World Champions, but again with a different lineup.  Nonetheless, they were the favorites for the event at the 1972 Summer Olympics, although they were not unchallenged entirely. Alfons Ślusarski and Jerzy Broniec, runners-up at the 1970 World Championships and winners of the 1972 Silver Goblets & Nickalls’ Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta, travelled to Germany, as did Roel Luynenburg and Ruud Stokvis of the Netherlands, who had put on a fantastic underdog performance at the previous Games, only to falter and finish last in the finals. More than a few spectators were hopeful that they would make the podium.
East Germany had the fastest time in the opening round, but was not completely dominant, as the Swiss duo of Fredy Bachmann and Heini Fischer, a lesser-known pair, won its heat in a time less than 0.16 seconds shy of the East Germans. The other two heats were won by crews from West Germany and the Soviet Union, both of whom were eliminated in the semi-finals. Despite the earlier success from the Swiss duo, the East Germans carried the day with ease, winning gold nearly four seconds ahead of Bachmann and Fischer, who settled for silver. Meanwhile, fans who wanted to see Luynenburg and Stokvis reach the podium were not disappointed:  a stunning battle between the Dutch pair and Czechoslovakia’s Lubomír Zapletal and Petr Lakomý, the reigning European silver medalists, earned the former the final podium spot by a photo-finish margin of 0.07 seconds.

Wolf had been the strongest 500 m skater since the 2006 Games, claiming the World Championship and the World Cup in the next three seasons. Wolf was also the fastest skater, with a world record of 37.00 seconds and seven of the ten fastest times recorded. Two of the other top-10 times had been set by Wang, three times runner-up to Wolf at the World Championships, but Wang had beaten Wolf at the 2009 World Sprint Championships, and twice during the ongoing World Cup season. Shortly before the Games, a third contender appeared. Already considered the “best of the rest” for some time, South Korean Lee Sang-Hwa finally managed to beat Wolf in one of the 500 ms at the World Sprint Championships, where she also took the overall title.
One of the other medal contenders, Annette Gerritsen of the Netherland was already out of contention in the first run, as she crashed out of the race in the first curve. At that point, Wang had taken the lead with a somewhat disappointing 34.487. Wolf was expected to beat this, which she did with 38.307. But in that race, Lee passed Wolf in the final straight to create a gap of about 0.05 seconds.
This left the competition wide open for the second run. It soon turned out that ice conditions had much improved. Wang considerably bettered her own first run time, and even bettered Lee’s mark with her 38.144, ensuring a bronze medal. The final pair between Lee and Wolf was an exciting one. Wolf recorded one of her stunning opening times (10.14), making up for the difference from the first race. But as in the first run, Lee drew closer. While she was unable to overtake her German rival, Lee was only 0.012 behind at the line, enough to claim South Korea’s second ever Olympic speed skating title - just one day after the first one (won by Mo Tae-Beom).

After Saturday, Meyer Prinstein led with 7.175 to Al Kraenzlein’s 6.93 metres.  Some sources claim that Prinstein and Kraenzlein both made an agreement at that point to not compete on Sunday.
Whether they did or not, Kraenzlein did jump on Sunday and edged out Prinstein by one centimetre.  Prinstein was outraged and may have punched Kraenzlein when the result was announced.  Though difficult to tell if any fists actually landed, he definitely had to be restrained to keep him from Kraenzlein.  The ironic thing about all this is that both Kraenzlein and Prinstein competed on their Sabbaths.  Prinstein, a Jew, competed on Saturday, while Kraenzlein, a Gentile, competed on Sunday.

There were 16 boats entered, with six fleet races held to advance 12 teams to two groups of round-robin match races.

This made Korea the first nation since the Soviet Union in 1960 to go 1-2 in this event.
Jin’s victory was historic in a number of ways. Most importantly, this made Jin the first shooter to ever win three individual gold medals in Olympic shooting. He also became the first shooter to win two gold medals at one Olympics since Unified Team shooter Marina Dobrancheva-Logvinenko in 1992, and only the second shooter to do so since 1924, back when there were numerous team events. In fact, Jin became only the seventh shooter to win two individual gold medals at one Olympics, following Dobrancheva-Logvinenko and five shooters from 1906-20. This was also his third consecutive medal in the event, as he had also won a silver in 2004.
The world #1 seed Damir Mikec of Serbia placed only 16th in qualifying, after a disappointing 90 in his second series.

Sandberg started well in the ski jumping, winning the event ahead of the relatively unknown Soviet skier, Sergey Chervyakov, with West Germany’s Thomas  Müller in third place. Miettinen placed sixth and Karjalainen was still in position for a medal, placing 15th out of the 28 competitors. Dotzauer jumped to 12th place and was a disappointment.
In the cross-country event, Karjalainen started one minute behind Sandberg as next-to-last of the 28 competitors, and had to beat his Norwegan rival by approximately 2:15 to pass him in the final classification. At 9 km he passed Sandberg on the cross-country track, but during the last six kilometers Sandberg gave away only 20 more seconds. Karjalainen won the cross-country race by a comfortable margin, but Sandberg placed second and could celebrate as the Olympic Champion. Karjalainen was an easy silver medalist and another Finn, 21-year old Jukka Ylipulli, was a surprise bronze medal winner after placing fifth in both the jumping and cross-country event. Miettinen ended his career by placing fourth, and West Germany’s Müller, third in the jumping event, was fifth, far better than expected.  Soviet’s Chervyakov dropped from second after the ski jump to 12th, but his 19-year old teammate, Ukrainian Aleksandr Prosvirnin advanced from 13th to sixth place, the best Soviet placing in Nordic Combined in twenty years.
Sandberg ended his last season impressively, winning the Nordic Combined World Cup for the 1983/84 season and finally winning another World Championship gold medal as a member of the Norwegian team in the Nordic combined team event in Rovaniemi, Finland in March. The Nordic combined team event had been held for the first time at the 1982 World Championships in Oslo.

The competition was extremely close as both Stogov and Vinci lifted 105.0 kg in both the press and snatch, entering the clean & jerk tied at 210.0 kg. Vinci took the gold medal when he outlifted Stogov in the clean & jerk, 132.5 to 127.5 kg, giving Vinci a world record total of 342.5 kg. Stogov also bettered the previous world record. Vinci came very close to not even starting as he had difficulty making weight, and only did so at the last minute, aided by a haircut just before the weigh-in. The bronze medal went to Iran’s Mahmoud Namdjou, the silver medalist from Helsinki, who had also been third behind Stogov and Vinci at the 1955 Worlds.

Though very young, Taylor turned professional and became a great champion in the pro ranks. He won the IBF light-welterweight title in 1988 and became WBA welterweight champion in 1991. In 1990 he fought the redoubtable Julio César Chávez for the WBA super-lightweight crown and was ahead on all cards through 11 rounds. With less than a minute to go in the fight, Taylor relaxed a bit and Chávez moved in and unloaded, knocking Taylor down with only 15 seconds left in the round. Although he got up, Taylor was out on his feet, and the referee stopped the fight with only two seconds remaining, Chávez winning by TKO.

Entering Rio in 2016, Icho also had 10 World titles to her credit (eight in 63 kg, two in 58 kg), and had gone undefeated in almost 13 years. Her 189 consecutive match-winning streak was finally broken in January 2016 by Mongolian wrestler Pürevdorjiin Orkhon, who had the best chance to dethrone the Olympic champion based on recent history, despite being world-ranked No. 7, coming into Rio.
Also in the hunt to prevent Icho from her place in history, were Petra Olli of Finland (world-ranked No. 1 in 60 kg) who lost to Icho at the 2015 World Championships, and Valeriya Koblova of Russia (world-ranked No. 2 in 58 kg, right behind Icho), who lost in the final to Icho at the 2014 World Championships.
En-route to the Rio gold medal final, Icho won two matches by technical fall, and gave up only a single point in her other match. However, in the final against the Russian Koblova, she found herself trailing late in the match, behind 2-1. Then, with five seconds left on the clock to make Olympic history, Icho was awarded a two-point score, and dramatically won 3-2. With the win, Icho became the first wrestler ever to win four Olympic gold medals. She was also the first female in any sport to win an individual-event gold at four Games.
Last-second victories were also pulled out in the two bronze medal matches, were the two winners both won their nations first-ever medals in women’s wrestling with late scores. In the first bronze medal bout, Marwa Amri of Tunisia scored a four-point take down with less than 10 seconds left to win 6-3 over Yuliya Ratkeviç of Azerbaijan. In bronze medal match number two between India’s Sakshi Malik and Kyrgyzstan’s Aysuluu Tynybekova, the points were tied at 5-5, with Tynybekova leading on criteria, but Malik then scored two points as time expired, and a failed challenge from Tynybekova made the final score 8-5 to the Indian.

After the first round of jumping he moved up a further two places with only Sara Algotsson of Sweden standing between him and a gold medal. Jung produced another classy display of jumping to ramp up the pressure but Algotsson’s nerve held steady until she made an error and dislodged a pole at the very last fence, giving Jung the gold medal.

Van Almsick had first been noticed at the German Nationals in April when she won this race in 2:00.05 before she had turned 14.
In the final, van Almsick went out quickly, leading at 50 metres. Haislett was next to her and was surprised to see the youthful van Almsick swimming next to her lane rope.

Van Almsick would win 10 Olympic medals in her career, but never a gold, and this race was as close as she ever came to the top step of the podium. Haislett competed only at one Olympics, 1992, winning three gold medals, with two in relays.

On each loop, they ascended a slightly steep climb, and a series of switchbacks, just after the 6 km. point, and then ascended gently for the next 2½ km.  The course began on the Via Flaminia, turned left onto the Via Di Grottarossa, and then returned to the start along the Via Cassia. The race was started in tremendous heat (38º C/100º F). At least one cyclist, Korean No Do-Cheon, succumbed to the heat and had to be carried off to the hospital. The Danish team did not start the race after the death of their compatriot Knud Enemark Jensen in the team time trial.
East Germany’s Gustav-Adolf Schur had won the Amateur Road Race World Championship in both 1958 and 1959, the first rider ever to defend that title.  In 1960, the title went to his teammate, Bernhard Eckstein.  Both riders competed in Rome and Schur had to be favored, but he was marked closely and never figured in any breakaways.  The race began at 0900.  On the second lap, the Netherlands’ Lex van Kreuningen, broke away and opened up 46 seconds on the peloton by the fourth lap.  On lap five, he was joined by his teammate Jan Hugens, and they led together thru lap six.  On the next lap, seven other riders caught the Dutch tandem, to make a lead group of nine.  This group included Italy’s Livio Trapè, and the Soviet Union’s Viktor Kapitonov.  Over the next two laps a few other riders joined the leaders, but on lap 10, Trapè and Kapitonov went off the front together, and had 52 seconds on the peleton at the end of that circuit.  As the two neared the end of lap 11, Kapitonov took off and started a mad sprint, thinking the race was ending.  But they had one more lap to go, and the two entered it with a lead of 2:29.  At the finish, Kapitonov had enough left to repeat his sprint and narrowly defeat Trapè. This greatly disappointed the Italian crowd, who had hoped for an Italian win, which would have completed a sweep of the cycling events. A pack of 39 riders closed on the two leaders in the last lap, but finished 20 seconds down.  This group included Schur and Eckstein, and the entire German team was placed consecutively from 20-23 place.
The 1960 cycling road race has been a difficult event to document statistically as the Official Report lists only the 76 finishing riders. It mentions that there were 142 riders from 42 nations, but the other 66 riders are not listed directly.  There are some lap results that help identify the non-finishers.  We have been able to identify what we believe is the correct list of non-finishers by using various sources.  We have contacted numerous national cycling federations, asking for their information on their national riders.  In a few cases, we contacted some of the supposed competitors directly.  We finally found a copy of the Official Program from the day of the race, which listed the starters, and was accompanied by a list entitled “Entry Modifications,” which noted when some riders did not start and some were replaced by other riders on their teams.  We believe the results listed below are the best representation of who actually started on 30 August 1960. However, there are also problems with who actually finished the race in certain positions, based on personal reports from the riders, and photographs of the finish. We have footnoted these as necessary, but these results do not quite follow the results in the Official Report precisely.
Part of the problem may arise from the actions of the treasurer of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), Albert Verougstraete, who was the judge at the finish line who was responsible for determining the final placements. But the Belgian judge listed the top 10 finishers and then left to have lunch, stating, “I’m hungry. I’ll issue a full list sometime tonight.”

Top seed Baker, the son of an American father but born and raised in Japan by his Japanese mother, took the gold, while third seeded Varlam Lip’art’eliani from Georgia and second seeded Gwak Dong-Han won silver and bronze, respectively. The other bronze medalist, China’s Cheng Xunzhao, was a surprise medalist from the lower part of the ranking list.
Baker was trained at the Kodokan, the world’s oldest and most prestigious Dojo (judo school). In his first three matches in Rio, he defeated his respective opponents by an Ippon (full point) after approximately two minutes of each contest. In the semi-final, it took him 4:40 min to apply a Kesa-gatame (scarf hold) for an Ippon to beat Cheng. In the final, however, he fought very defensively after scoring a Yuko (advantage) after 2:17 min. To the displeasure of the crowd, Baker carefully held on to this minimal lead although he conceded two penalties for defensive posture. The desperate Lip’art’eliani, however, also failed to score, and thus the Georgian had to settle for silver.
Korea’s reigning World Champion Gwak lost his semi-final against Lip’art’eliani but at least claimed bronze, along with China’s Cheng. Refugee Olympic Athlete Popole Misenga, who defected from the Democratic Republic of Congo, gave a good performance. He defeated India’s Avtar Singh in the first round and resisted Gwak for four minutes in the second.

Gulyayev had also won one World Cup during the season, in Innsbruck. But the leader in the 1,500 m World Cup standings was André Hoffmann, who had not been very successful until the start of the season, when he won the first two World Cups. Also performing well in recent races were Eric Flaim and Michael Hadschieff, who had placed fourth and sixth in the Olympic 1,000 m.
The competition started with Flaim breaking the world record, taking off 0.38 seconds and setting it at 1:52.12.

With star players like Ronaldo and Bebeto in attendance, the South Americans suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Japan in their first match, but the team recovered to reach the semi-finals. There, they met Nigeria, which had already lost to Brazil in the group stage. The Africans had a team composed of star players from several European leagues, and five had competed in the 1994 World Cup. But the “Super Eagles” trailed 3-1 at the interval.
Following an Ikpeba goal, a late shot by Nwankwo Kanu forced the match into overtime. For the first time the, golden goal rule was in force, meaning the first team to score in extra time would win the match. Kanu secured his role as man of the match by scoring just minutes into extra time. Nigeria encountered a second South American opponent in the final, Argentina. The match was somewhat overshadowed by blunders from the referee and his linesman. Argentina pulled ahead 2-1 from a rather undeserved spot kick, and the match decider two minutes before the final whistle was scored with three Nigerians in offside position. But this did not matter to the Nigerians, who celebrated Africa’s first Olympic gold medal in football.
In the years since the Atlanta Olympics many questions have been asked about the true ages of certain members of the Nigerian squad. Allegations that as many as half the team were overage, some by as many as ten years, have been made but none has been proved beyond doubt to be true.

Dan Jansen had won the first 1,000 m at the World Sprint Champions a week before the Games, but after hearing of his sister’s death shortly before the start of the 500 m, Jansen had fallen in his race, and it was unclear what to expect of him. Jansen’s team mate Eric Flaim was better known as a miler, but had won the second 1,000 m at West Allis. The winner of the Olympic 500 m, Uwe-Jens Mey had won two World Cup races in the 1,000 during the season and was highly considered. In addition, there were two Soviet skaters, Igor Zhelezovsky and Nikolay Gulyayev. Zhelezovsky was the 1985 and 1986 World Sprint Champion, and held the 1,500 m world record. Gulyayev had been the star of the 1987 season, winning both the European and World Allround Championships. But at the Davos World Cup in January, it was revealed that Norwegian team members had intercepted packages of anabolic steroids. They had been intended for Stein Olav Krosby, who had been regularly receiving packages of the drugs from Gulyayev, usually using a middle man to deliver them to Krosby. While a Soviet team doctor was fired, Gulyayev was not punished by the Soviet skating federation. As Gulyayev had not tested positive himself, and possession of doping was not illegal per Olympic rules, Gulyayev was able to take part in Calgary as planned.
Of these contenders, Gulyayev was the first to skate. As an allround skater, his 200 m split was relatively poor, but his full laps of 27.16 and 28.70 brought him to 1:13.03, half a second behind the official world record (in March 1987, both Nick Thometz and Andrey Bakhvalov had been faster than Pavel Pegov’s 1:12.58, but their times were not held in an officially announced competition). In the next race, Jansen was, as expected, ahead of Gulyayev’s splits, before falling once again. Pair five then saw Mey and Zhelezovsky race each other. Mey, the better 500 m racer, was well ahead at the bell, while Zhelezovsky matched Gulyayev’s splits. But Mey faded in the final lap. While he was able to hold off Zhelezovsky, he was unable to best Gulyayev’s time, finishing in 1:13.11, against 1:13.19 for his opponent. Flaim, too, was level with Gulyayev at 600 m, but lost half a second in the last lap.

In the butterfly final, Biondi went out ahead well ahead to the wall. He led the race until the last stroke, but as he neared the wall, he was between strokes and elected to kick in, only to be slightly farther out than he realized, and this allowed Suriname’s Anthony Nesty to pass him and win the gold medal by 1/100th of a second. Nesty was not unknown, having placed fourth at the 1986 World Championships, and winning gold at the 1987 Pan American Games, but this was an upset, and it was the first Olympic medal ever won for Suriname, and also made Nesty the first black swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal.
Nesty had trained and lived and went to college in the United States for several years. But he considered Suriname home and returned to a hero’s welcome, being showered with gifts. He would return to Barcelona four years hence and add a bronze medal in this event. Biondi recovered fairly well from his poor start in Seoul, winning five golds in his last five races.

All boxers in this class, their names remain as answers to the trivia question of who lost to the eventual winner, one Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr.. The original favorite in the event was either the Pole Pietrzykowski, who had won Olympic bronze in 1956 as a light-middleweight, and was already a three-time European champion (1955, 1957, 1959), or Shatkov, the 1956 Olympic gold medalist as a middleweight. But the American coaches touted Clay, a reed-thin 18-year-old with lightning-fast hands from Louisville, Kentucky, who stood 187 cm (6-3) tall, and would later grow into a large heavyweight. Clay had won the Chicago Golden Gloves title in 1959 and 1960, adding the 1960 AAU titles and Olympic Trials. In Rome, he won his first bout over Becaus by TKO, then won unanimous decisions over Shatkov and Madigan to advance to the final against Pietrzykowski. Pietrzykowski was a formidable opponent and had a slight lead after two rounds, but Clay, told by his seconds that he needed to knockout the Pole to win, pummeled him in the final round. Pietrzykowski stayed upright, but Clay had another unanimous decision and the gold medal.
Pietrzykowski would come back in 1964 to add a bronze medal in this class, and he won his fourth European title in 1963. Right after the Olympics, Clay turned professional, winning his first fight against Tunney Hunsaker. In 1964 he would win the world heavyweight title by defeating the Big Bear, Sonny Liston. Clay became one of the world’s most popular athletes. Handsome, he never failed to mention that fact, calling himself pretty, and he began reciting poetry, often before his bouts, and often predicting in which rounds he would knock out his opponent. “Float like a buttefly, sting like a bee, his hands can’t hit, what his eyes can’t see”, became his mantra.
After winning the world professional title, Clay adopted the Muslim faith and took the name Muhammad Ali, by which he would become forever after known. Ali claimed conscientious objection to the war in Vietnam and was stripped of his professional title by US authorities, stating “I ain’t got no quarrel with them Vietcong.” He fought the decision, eventually winning in the US Supreme Court, and then came back to boxing. In the early 1970s Ali had three epic bouts with the 1964 Olympic heavyweight gold medalist, Joe Frazier, winning the last two, including the final drama, The Thrilla in Manila, considered by many as the greatest heavyweight bout ever. Ali would eventually win the world heavyweight title three times, also defeating the 1968 gold medalist, George Foreman, and the 1976 light-heavyweight gold medalist, Leon Spinks, to do so. Sadly, like many boxers, he fought too long, and later suffered from Parkinson’s disease, probably from the effects of so many punches causing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which rendered the Louisville Lip silent. In 1996 he thrilled American sports fans when “The Greatest” overcame his shaking to light the Olympic torch at the Atlanta Opening Ceremony.

Elliot and Jensen tied for first place but Jensen was awarded first place by the judges, based on his having lifted in a better style, as apparently Elliot moved one foot while lifting his weight.  From the article by Ian Buchanan in Citius, Altius, Fortius (Vol. 3, No. 1, p. 20), we have:
“The two-handed lift came first on the program and, after a long drawn out contest, Viggo Jensen of Denmark and Elliot had both lifted 110 kg., but Prince George awarded the Dane first place for having done so in better style.  Jensen’s lift was accomplished with a superb clean lift whereas Elliot had certainly encountered difficulty but to award the Olympic title on the basis of ‘style’ was a decision to which Lawrence Levy, understandably, took exception.
“Levy’s main objection was that, as both contestants had lifted the same weight, they should now each be given the chance to lift a heavier weight in accordance with all known weightlifting protocol.  Prince George then agreed with Levy’s view but the decision was rendered academic by the rider to the judgment that there were, in fact, no heavier weights available.  Levy stood his ground and eventually plates were screwed onto the barbell and lifting was resumed.  After Jensen had raised the bar, Levy again objected, this time on the grounds that Jensen’s method was not in accordance with the rules.
“Again Prince George sided against Levy and once more lifting was resumed, by which time most of the spectators had left but they didn’t miss a great deal as, eventually, the original result based on ‘style’ was allowed to stand.  By contrast, the one-handed event was a short, sharp event.  Elliot declined Prince George’s courteous offer of a rest break but he asked that he might this time lift after Jensen, as in the two-handed event the Dane had the advantage of lifting after Elliot.  The request was granted although the order of lifting was not to have a material effect on the result.  Elliot raised 71.0 kg. without difficulty whereas Jensen, who had injured his shoulder trying to raise 112.5 kg. in the two-handed event, could only manage 57.2 kg. and Britain’s first Olympic champion was crowned.
“One feature that stands out from the judging of the competition is the inherent courtesy exercised by Prince George throughout the proceedings.  Despite the constant protests of Lawrence Levy, the Prince sought him out that evening at an illumination display at the Royal Palace, and smilingly enquired ‘Are you calmer now, Mr. Levy?’”
Levy was apparently unaware of the rules stating that the tie-breaker was the style of the lift.

With a desperate final sprint Curtis touched the wall ahead of the Dane to break the Olympic record and clinch the championship. Curtis’ time of 1:04.4 was the fastest ever recorded though it could not be ratified as a world record because only the first leg of a relay is allowed to stand for record purposes

The latter team was expected to feature 5000 m champion Chad Hedrick and eventual 1000 m champion Shani Davis. However, Davis forfeited his spot on the team to focus on individual events, at the displeasure of Hedrick, who had announced his goal of five golds prior to the Games. This incident was blown up by the US press, but Davis did not compete.
A weak time by the Americans in the ranking round left them drawn against Italy, who had been silver medalists at the first World Championships the previous year. Despite strong efforts by Hedrick, the Italians advanced to the semi-finals against the Dutch. In a close race, up and coming star Sven Kramer stumbled, taking a team mate with him and leaving the Italians certain of a medal. In the other semi-final, the well-trained Canadians easily outraced Norway.
In the final, the Italians were much stronger then their opponents, and grabbed their country’s first ever Olympic speed skating title. Italian newspaper reports of the victory spent much of their columns on explaining the sport to readers unfamiliar with it. Enrico Fabris was the team’s captain, having won Italy’s first ever bronze medal earlier that week in the 5000 m, and winning the 1500 m later in the Games. Ippolito Sanfratello, had been an inline skater for most of his career, but had switched to the ice to compete in the Olympics.

Fourth-place was also a dead-heat between Deibler and Čavić.
For Phelps this was his final individual gold medal of a vaunted Olympic career. It was his 11th individual gold medal and 17th gold medal in all – he would later win #18 in the 4×100 medley relay.

Wszoła then got over 2.23 (7-3¾) on his first attempt, as did Canada’s Greg Joy, to the delight of the Montréal crowd. Stones failed at that height and had to settle for his second consecutive bronze medal.

In addition, Lipp was labeled by Soviet authorities as a risk to defect and it is likely he would not have been allowed to travel, even if the USSR had sent a team to London. In Lipp’s absence the favorite was probably the Frenchman, Ignace Heinrich. The 1948 AAU/Olympic Trials champion had been Bob Mathias, a 17-year-old who had competed in his first decathlon only two weeks before the AAU Meet.

The Argentine, Enrique Kistenmacher, led after the first day with Heinrich second. The second day had miserable conditions, with cold, rainy weather present throughout. Mathias took the lead after the discus throw, although in that event, officials had lost the marker on his best throw, and he likely lost several feet, and points, because of that. He held on to win the event from there, with Heinrich placing second when he outran Simmons in the 1,500.

Only one American, Wallace Spearmon, made the final.
Bolt was in lane seven in the final, with all his challengers inside, Blake in lane four, Spearmon in six, and the Netherlands’ Churandy Martina in lane five. But the race was over quickly. Bolt went through the curve in 10.0, a good two metres up on Blake. The third Jamaican runner, Warren Weir, was in third entering the straightaway.

It was left to 38-year-old veteran Valentina Vezzali to deliver the coup de grace on Russia thereby helping Italy to the Olympic title and herself to a sixth career Olympic gold. She had won a medal in each of the nine Olympic events she contested between 1996 and 2012.
The bronze medal was won by South Korea, their first ever in Olympic team fencing.
Vezzali was elected to the Italian Parliament in 2013 as a member of the newly formed centrist Scelta Civica party led by former Prime Minister Mario Monti.

Spain even took the lead in the final through star player Víctor Pujol. This unleashed the Dutch, and specialist Floris Jan Bovelander pushed two penalty corners behind the Spanish goalkeeper.

A seventh world crown for Italian Eugenio Monti in 1966 was sandwiched between victories for Great Britain in 1965 and a first ever world title for Austria on the Olympic track in 1967. Added to the list of possible challengers were the West German bobs driven by Horst Floth and Wolfgang Zimmerer  along with bobs from Switzerland, Romania, Canada and the USA.
At forty years of age Eugenio Monti  was not the dominant force he had been in earlier years but on the first run at L’Alpe d’Huez he recaptured his form of the early part of the decade and posted a track record in taking the lead ahead of Romania I and Great Britain I.
The second run was won by Horst Floth  of West Germany but at the end of the first day Monti had increased his lead to a third of a second. The competition had already been delayed for a day due to adverse weather conditions and the concluding two runs were to be held on the 11th February, three days after originally scheduled.  A stunning third run from Floth meant that West Germany leapt to the top of the standings with a tenth of the second to spare over their Italian rivals. Starting early on the final run Monti shot down the track and smashed the track record with a time of 1:10.05 then had to suffer a long wait until the leaders came down the course. Floth made an excellent start but lost vital fractions of time later down the track. As the German pair crossed the finish line the clock stopped at 1:10.15 and the gold medal appeared to be shared between West Germany and Italy. Shortly afterwards, with the Germans already celebrating, a loudspeaker announcement broke the news that regulations stated that in the event of a tie the crew that recorded the fastest single run would be regarded as champions.
Whilst this was a cruel blow to Floth  and Bader  there was a genuine feeling of delight that the efforts of Eugenio Monti, four times previously a medallist but never Olympic champion, had been rewarded with a place on the top of the podium in his final year of competition. Third place finishers were the crew from Romania who became the first Eastern European Olympic bobsleigh medallists and, as of 2010, the only Romanians to have won a medal at the Winter Games.

The host nation was also admitted, along with continental qualifiers Algeria, Brazil, Kuwait and Spain.
Sweden were easily the best team in Pool A. Their strongest opposition came from the Russians, which tied 20-20 shortly before time only to lose out 22-20. But the real drama was in the Croatia - Russia match, which was to decide the second qualifier from the group. With 37 seconds left to play, the score tied at 24-24, Dmitry Torgovanov was penalized, and the successive Croatian attack was crowned with a goal by Božidar Jović. The Croatians went through to the semis, despite losing by a large margin to Sweden in their fifth group match (27-18).
In the other pool, World Champions France played as expected, winning their first four matches before succumbing to Germany in the last match (24-23), yet securing qualification for the semi-finals. The remaining ticket was to be decided between Spain, silver medallists at the European Championships a few months before the Games, and Egypt, which had the best ever African performance at the World Championships, with a sixth place. Each team had three wins and a loss (against France) before they faced each other in the final pool game. The Spaniards were in the lead throughout the game, but Egypt was never far, losing out only 20-19.
The Spaniards, featuring 1992 champion Talant Duyshebayev (then with the Unified Team), didn’t hold out in the semi-finals, and they were outclassed by Sweden 25-20. The other semi-final was a replay of the 1995 World Championships final. The Croatians were eager for revenge, and took an early lead. By half-time, that had been increased to four points, which was never relinquished and held until the end (24-20).
In the final, the Swedes started out poorly. Croatia capitalized on that, building up an early lead that had stretched to five goals at the half-time mark (16-11). In an all-out effort to prevent a repeat of their loss in the 1992 Olympic final, Sweden initiated a comeback. Wingers Pierre Thorsson (8 goals) and Erik Hajas (7) brought their team closer and closer, but not close enough to hold the Croatians from winning by one goal (27-26). For Croatia, it was the first ever Olympic title won by that country. Five of its players had already earned a bronze while still playing for Yugoslavia back in 1988: Alvaro Načinović, Goran Perkovac, Iztok Puc, Zlatan Saračević and Irfan Smajlagić.
One of the players on the Spanish team that earned the bronze medal turned out to have an excellent Olympics for other reasons as well. Iñaki Urdangarín met Princess Cristina de Borbón, herself a sailing competitor at the 1988 Olympics; they married in 1997. In late 2011, Urdangarín discredited the royal family by being named in a corruption and money laundering case, which is still under investigation as of 2012.

Golovkin had a remarkable record in the amateur ranks and at the start of the Athens games had only lost 3 of his 300+ fights.  After an untroubled run to the semi-finals he saw off the challenge of the fancied American Andre Dirrell to set up a meeting with Sydney Olympic finalist Gaydarbek Gaydarbekov of Russia for the gold medal. 
Gaydarebekov had recently won the European Championships at the middleweight limit but it was still a surprise when he recovered from a four-point deficit at the end of the 1st round to dominate the last half of the fight and become the 1st Russian to win gold in the this division since [Vyacheslav Lemeshev] won for the Soviet Union in 1972. This was the high point of Gaydarebekov’s career and he drifted into retirement shortly after the Games ended.
Golovkin suffered a shock defeat at the 2005 World Championships and afterwards decided to embark on a career as a professional. By 2013 he was established as one of the stars of the sport and has held the WBA world title since 2010.

Between them they had won the distance at most of the recent international tournaments, including the 1966 and 1967 World and European Championships. But the 1968 Europeans had been held shortly before the Winter Olympics and that distance was won by Soviet skater Eduard Matusevich. Another contender was the world record holder, Magne Thomassen of Norway, who had recorded 2:02.5 in Davos only 11 days previously.
Schenk and Matusevich were the first favorites off, together in the second pair, and Schenk posted 2:05.0 for the others to shoot at, while Matusevich trailed in 2:06.1, and would eventually place eighth. Verkerk was in the sixth pair and he was right on pace through 700 metres, and slightly ahead at 1,100. He finished in 2:03.4, which would easily win him the gold medal. Five pairs later, Norway’s Ivar Eriksen came through to tie Schenk in 2:05.0. He was followed by Thomassen, who skated in the 12th pair, and finished in 2:05.1, just outside the medals.
Verkerk had been around since 1963 at an international level and his career would last until 1974, during which he would win the 1966 and 1967 World Championships and the 1967 European Championship. He would finish his career with four Olympic medals, but this would be his only gold. Schenk would soon become the greatest skater in the world, and one of the greatest ever. In 1972 at Sapporo, he would gold medals in all but the 500 metres. During his career he set 18 world records, and won the World Championships consecutively from 1970-72 and the European Championships in 1966 and 1970.

He lost the final on decision to Harry Spanjer, while Russell Van Horn took third place. But more than a year later, Egan was discovered to have been fighting under an alias. This was not uncommon at the time, as many more wealthy citizens did not want to be associated with sports. Egan’s real name was Frank Floyd, and he came from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. While this may not seem serious, by the rules of the AAU it was illegal to fight under an assumed name, a so-called ringer. In November 1905, the AAU decided that Egan would be disqualified from all AAU competitions, and he would have to return his prizes. The Atlantic Association that had knowingly accepted Floyd’s application as Egan was also expelled from the AAU.
This late decision to revise the Olympic results in this event has, as far as we know, never been published since the events in 1905, and was only rediscovered in 2008 by Taavi Kalju. More than 100 years after the fact, Peter Sturholdt can be recognized as a new Olympic medallist. This is even more remarkable considering he never won a single fight. In the quarter-finals, he was originally listed as having narrowly lost to Carroll Burton. While Burton was a well-known St. Louis fighter, the Olympic boxer was a different person. Like Egan, he had used a false name to compete, but his real identity, James Bollinger, was uncovered after the fight. This moved Sturholdt through to the semi-final by disqualification, where he lost against Egan. He then also lost the match for third place against Van Horn.

However she was then blessed by a piece of good luck when the Nigerian Olympic Committee announced that it would not be taking up the qualifying position earned by its top female fencer. Suddenly Zagunis was back in contention.
Ranked only at #3 of the three woman US team,  Zagunis was a revelation as the tournament progressed and, as more experienced fencers were defeated, she continued to win and found herself facing former World Champion Tan Xue of China for the Olympic championship.

Americans fencers had first competed at the Olympic Games in 1900 but only Albertson Van Zo Post had previously clinched Olympic gold and he had done it in the long abandoned  discipline of single sticks and against a field entirely populated by Americans.

Jordan Larsson, the son of former Feyenoord, Celtic and Barcelona forward Henrik Larsson, was pulled out of the Swedish squad just two weeks before the start of the Olympics by the manager of his club side Helsingborgs, because he claimed the club had just one fit striker so they could not afford to let him go to Rio! The Helsingborgs manager was… his father Henrik.
Colombia, with 2014 World Cup star Teo Gutierrez, along with Argentina and the defending champions Mexico, who beat Brazil in the final at London 2012, were all considered to be in with a chance and one could never write off the likes of the 1996 champions Nigeria, who benefited from having Chelsea’s John Obi Mikel in their very young squad. At the start of the Games they had three 19-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and one 17-year old in their squad but, it must be remembered, the great Pelé made his World Cup début at just 17! Argentina won the South American Under-20 tournament to qualify for Rio and their squad contained Atlético Madrid’s Angel Correa and Giovanni Simeone, the tournament’s top scorer with nine goals. He is the son of Atlético Madrid manager and former Argentina international and Olympian Diego Simeone.
The Nigerian squad nearly never made it to Rio. En route, they were stuck in Atlanta, USA, the day before the men’s competition started, with a problem over payment for a flight, and then they had to wait for a replacement plane because the original one was too small to take them down to Manaus for their opening game in the Amazon Rain Forest region. They arrived just hours before the scheduled kick-off. It didn’t do Oghenekaro Etebo any harm as he scored four goals in a 5-4 win over Japan in the first Olympic men’s match to see nine goals scored in it since 1964, when the UAR beat South Korea 10-0. In another high-scoring opener Seung-Woo Ryu scored an hat-trick as South Korea beat Fiji 8-0 in the highest scoring men’s game since the Soviet Union beat Cuba by the same score in 1984.
Brazil were booed off the pitch after their opening match, which saw them held to a goalless draw by 10-man South Africa, and they were jeered by their own fans again in the second game against the débutant outsiders Iraq, as they were held to a goalless draw again. They were in danger of being eliminated and, with it, the chance of that elusive Olympic gold medal, but they eventually gave their fans something to cheer when they beat group leaders Denmark to set up a meeting with their fellow South Americans Colombia in the knockout stage.
In their second group game, Erick Gutiérrez scored four second half goals for the defending champions Mexico, to turn around a 1-0 half-time deficit against Fiji. Sweden, one of the favourites finished bottom of their group but another of the European hopefuls, Portugal, qualified and set up an interesting last-eight clash with Germany. Like Brazil, Germany went into their final group game winless after two draws but that all changed when they beat Fiji 10-0, with Nils Petersen  scoring five goals and Max Meyer bagging a hat-trick. It was the biggest win at the Olympics since that UAR win back in 1964.
At last Neymar got onto the score-sheet as Brazil beat Colombia in an ill-tempered match as they reached the semi-finals, and Germany, like Brazil, moved closer to their first Olympic title with a comfortable 5-0 win over Portugal in the quarters, with Serge Gnabry maintaining his record of scoring in every game. Nigeria reached their third semi-final in seven Olympics, and completing the last four line-up was Honduras, which assured them of their highest ever finish and the hope of their first ever Olympic medal in any sport.
Sadly for the Hondurans their first medal was not to be gold or silver, as there was no stopping the now rampant Brazilians, as Neymar opened the scoring after just 14 seconds of their semi-final encounter. It was the fastest ever Olympic goal, beating by six seconds the one scored by Janine Beckie of Canada in their opening Rio match against Australia two weeks earlier. Neymar scored again in the final minute as they ousted the plucky qualifiers 6-0. Having seen their women qualify for the final the day before, the German men beat Nigeria thanks to an early goal from Lukas Klostermann and an 89th minute a second goal from Nils Petersen as they became the first country to contest both men’s and women’s finals at the same Olympics.
Nigeria won their first medal of the Games by beating Honduras 3-2 in the bronze medal match. At 3-0, thanks to goals from Sadiq Umar (2) and Aminu Umar, it looked all over, but Anthony Lozano pulled one back for Honduras in the 71st minute and Marcelo Pereira headed home a second four minutes form time to make it a nervous final few minutes. The Africans held on, however, for that first medal in Rio and their third football one to go with the gold they won in 1996 and silver in 2008.
The final, played in front of 79,000 fanatical Brazilians in the Maracanã, saw Brazil and Germany dish up a feast of non-stop football, which was a complete contrast to the last time these two teams met in a major competition, the semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, when Germany won 7-1. By the time Neymar opened the scoring for the hosts in the 27th minute it could well have been Germany who were in the lead as they had hit the woodwork several times. Far from feeling down at conceding, Germany kept coming at Brazil, but had to wait until the 59th minute before Max Meyer broke them down and equalised. It was the first goal Brazil had conceded in 509 minutes of football at these Games. Both sides continued to press for the winning goal in the remainder of the 90 minutes and the period of extra-time that followed but, despite some very tired legs towards the end, it remained 1-1 and it was down to penalties to decide the first men’s Olympic final to go to a shoot-out since Cameroon beat Spain in 2000.
Germany took the first spot-kick and like each of the first eight, was converted. Each side had one kick left before a possible sudden-death but Freiburg striker Nils Petersen saw his kick saved by Wéverton. It was now down to Neymar, the Brazil captain who, along with his team-mates, had been jeered and booed by the home fans after their first two lacklustre performances to become a national hero. That status was achieved by converting that final spot-kick as he gave Brazil their first ever Olympic football gold medal. Of course, Brazil wanted to win as many medals as they could on home soil, but the one medal they desperately wanted more than any other was the elusive football gold, and they got it.

Fourth seed Hisayoshi Harasawa just narrowly missed a medal, squeezed out by Frenchman Teddy Riner. Lukáš Krpálek from the Czech Republic clinched his second gold after his victory in the half-heavyweight at the 2016 Olympics. He was also seventh at London 2012. In both categories he was a world champion, in the heavyweight in 2019 and half-heavyweight in 2014. Krpálek only required extra time for a Golden Score in his semi-final against Harasawa after 7:59 min. In the final he faced Guram Tushishvili from Georgia, Krpálek’s predecessor as world champion in 2018. Although the Czech was charged with two Shidos (penalties) after less than three minutes into the bout, he returned to win by scoring two Waza-aris (half points) within 20 seconds of the final minute. Tushishvili toppled all his previous opponents by Ippon (full point), and, like Krpálek, required the Golden Score just once, against 2012 and 2016 bronze medallist Rafael Silva in the quarter-final. Third seed Tamerlan Bashayev, Tushishvili’s opponent in the semi-final, won his fight for bronze. Bashayev ousted the favourite, French giant Riner, in the quarter-final. The outcome of this fight was still considered a surprise, regardless of the ranking list, and Bashayev’s silver at the 2021 World Championships.
Riner, however, bronze medallist in 2008 at the age of 19 and gold medallist in 2012 and 2016, secured a bronze medal in the repêchage when Harasawa was disqualified for non-combativity after receiving his third Shido. Riner was definitely one of the most successful judokas of the last decade, winning medals in the heavyweight at four consecutive Olympic Games. In Tokyo, he added yet another gold medal to his tally, winning the mixed team event with France.

In that event Slovenian Žan Košir had taken bronze, but he and Wild would meet in the final of this event.
Wild had made the final by defeating Austrian Benjamin Karl, the 2009 and 2011 World Champion, in the semi-finals. Wild won the gold medal comfortably for his second gold medal in Sochi, while Karl easily won the bronze medal race over Italian Aaron March.

The final saw Matthes started slowly as the early lead was set by American Mitch Ivey, followed by his teammate Mike Stamm, silver medalist in the 100 back. Ivey still led at 100 metres but Matthes had moved into second, but he caught Ivey at 125 metres and had a full bodylength lead by the final turn, the race all but over. He eventually won by over a second, but Stamm came on strong to catch a tiring Ivey and won the silver medal.

World record holder in the event since 1990, she was the defending champion from Albertville 1992. She had also won the event at the 1991, 1992 and 1993 World Championships (when she also won the allround world title), and six times in a row at the European Championships from 1989 through 1994. Having skated 4.12 at the World Cup and European Championships (both held in Hamar), it was thought she might even approach the world record.
But things turned out differently. Skating in the third pair, Gunda Niemann stepped on a lane marker and fell after about 430 m. Taking her opponent Seiko Hashimoto with her, Niemann got up quickly and continued her race. But in the confusion, she continued in the wrong lane, for which she was eventually disqualified. With Niemann gone, this left Olympic gold up for grabs. Her compatriot, 1992 bronze medalist in the 5,000 m, Claudia Pechstein, was leading after Niemann’s fall with a strong time of 4:18.34. She had defeated another favorite, Carla Zijlstra, who had won the last pre-Olympic World Cup in absence of Niemann. In pair four, Hungarian-born Emese Hunyady (Austria) skated. The 1993 European Champion started out carefully, giving her the power for three fast final laps, landing her just ahead of Pechstein with 4:18.14. After six pairs, there was only one serious contender left: Svetlana Bazhanova. The Russian had placed second behind Niemann in the Berlin and Davos World Cups earlier in the year, and had been 3rd in the 3,000 m at the European Championships earlier in the season (behind Niemann and Zijlstra). Starting with the same pace as Pechstein, Bazhanova held on longer than the German, finishing in a new personal best of 4:17.43. The Olympic gold would remain Bazhanova’s only international title. In 1993 and 1998, she did win bronze medals at the European Allround Championships.

These two nations won their heats in both the opening round and the semi-finals, with Hungary’s Anna Pfeffer and Klára Rajnai taking the third heat in the latter portion of the competition. Pfeffer had multiple international medals in canoeing, including Olympic silver from the 1968 K-2 500 tournament and a World title in the same event from 1971, while Rajnai won a surprise bronze medal in the K-1 500 the day prior to this event’s final. These three nations were ahead of the rest of the pack in the medal round and were nearly neck and neck as they approached the finish line. The Soviet Union pulled just enough ahead to take gold by 0.54 seconds, while Hungary’s margin of victory for the silver medal was much smaller, a mere 0.12 seconds, over East Germany. Although Zirzow failed to earn gold in this event, she had already become an Olympic champion earlier in the day in the K-1 500.

They had raced at the distance only once before, at the 1978 European Championships, with Ovett winning silver and Coe bronze, both beaten by the GDR’s Olaf Beyer. The only top runner missing in Moskva was American Don Paige, who would have challenged in both the 800 and 1,500. Coe was the world record holder, having recorded 1:42.4 in Oslo at the 1979 Bislett Games. He had also broken the 1,500 and mile world record in 1979, but in 1980, Ovett bettered both those marks prior to the Olympics. Coe was a slight favorite with Ovett considered better over the longer distance. The pace was very slow in the final, led by Brazil’s Agberto Guimarães on the first lap. Soviet Nikolay Kirov then took the lead thru 600 metres when Ovett moved up on the final curve. He had the lead at the start of the stretch, with Coe far back and unable to make up enough ground, although he closed quickly to get the silver medal.

US skater Erin Jackson is a former inline speed skater, having won seven medals at World Championships in the sport. After trying ice speed skating for the first time in 2016, she seriously converted the following year. After only a few months in the sport, she qualified for the 2018 Olympics, where she finished in 24th place in the 500 m.
At the 2019 Worlds, she improved to 15th and then was seventh at the 2020 edition. Choosing not to attend the “COVID bubble” of Heerenveen in 2021, she emerged as one of the surprises when the World Cups resumed with a full field in the 2021/22 season. She won the first three World Cup races of the season, adding a fourth in Salt Lake City, as well as two more podium finishes.
These performances made Jackson one of the pre-Games favorites, but she still had to place among the top two at the US Olympic Trials. Midway through her race, she had an unusual miss-stroke, briefly losing pace and finishing in third. Normally, this would have cost her a spot at the Olympic Games, but teammate Brittany Bowe, who had won the trial race, decided to give up her spot. Long-time friend Bowe, like Jackson, hailed from the Florida town of Ocala, and both had learned inline speed skating there as children.
Although Bowe’s gesture ultimately had no effect on herself (she was allowed to skate the 500 m after the US was granted a third quota spot), the action was widely praised, including naturally by Jackson herself.
In Beijing, Jackson produced a fitting conclusion to her journey. Racing in the penultimate pair, she clocked 37.04, good enough for a gold medal. This made her the first female Black skater to become Olympic champion, and only the second Black skater after Shani Davis. Joining her on the podium were the surprising Miho Takagi, who had earlier won silver in the 1,500 m, and 2021 World Champion Angelina Golikova. Plagued by back injuries earlier in the season, 2019 World Champion Vanessa Herzog recorded a second consecutive fourth place. With her victory Jackson also became the first Black individual gold medalist at the Winter Olympics, in any sport.

The riders were sent off at two minute intervals, with the last scheduled rider starting at 7 AM (0700).  Of the 151 entrants only 123 riders eventually started.  The individual event was won by Rudolph “Okey” Lewis of South Africa.  He started quickly and led by 11½ minutes at 120 km.  Increasing the lead to 17 minutes at 200 km., he slowed slightly coming in, but still won by almost nine minutes over Freddie Grubb of Great Britain.  As the second starter, going off at 2:02 AM, he was the first overall finisher as well.  Little is known about Lewis’ cycling career, even by South African experts.  It was noted that the weather at the start time of 2 AM was cool, with no wind, which favored the very early starters.  By 7 AM a strong westerly wind was blowing directly into the faces of the later starting riders.  As the second starter, Lewis definitely benefited from his start position.
The previous record for the Mälaren Rundt was 11-22:07.0, set in 1909 by Henrik Morén of Sweden, a 10-time winner of the race, including nine consecutive wins from 1902-1910.

The IOC initially voted against the proposal, but a compromise was eventually reached that excluded only so-called “full professionals,” defined as those who had played at least one full match in the FIFA World Cup, but only for nations from Europe and South America.
Following the Soviet-led boycott, all three medallists from the 1980 Games withdrew. Of the three 1984 medallists, only Yugoslavia had won an Olympic football medal before, although France and Brazil could hardly be called newcomers to the sport - the French national squad had won Euro ‘84 earlier that year. Brazil’s appearance in the final marked the first South American team in the closing rounds of the tournament since Uruguay and Argentina in 1928. Playing with future World Cup winner Dunga, Brazil was unable to topple the French team. They were coached by Henri Michel, who would go on to coach France at the 1986 World Cup. He also coached three African teams at World Cups: Cameroon, Morocco and Cote d’Ivoire. A novelty at the 1984 Olympics was the use of penalty kicks to decide drawn matches in the knock-out phase. It was first used in the quarter-final between Brazil and Canada.

Brown was plagued by ill luck in the shape of a throat infection which forced him into a hospital bed prior to his semi-final. He was then upset by Filipino Anthony Villanueva, the son of 1932 boxing medallist José Villanueva, on a points decision. Stepashkin was expected to overwhelm his opponent in the final but the fight did not follow the plan and many at ringside thought that Villanueva had done enough to become Olympic champion. Three of the five judges decided that the Soviet deserved to win and Stepashkin was crowned Olympic champion. Stepashkin won European titles each side of his Olympic triumph but failed to gain selection for the 1968 Games and retired. He became a trainer and coached national teams from Algeria, Cameroon and the Seychelles as well as in his native country of Russia.

When the US won in a big upset, Heiden was excited, having two close friends on the US team, and he slept little. Oversleeping a bit, his breakfast consisted only of a few pieces of bread grabbed on the way to the rink. The first pair was a tough one with Norway’s Tom Erik Oxholm, who had won bronze in the 5,000, facing American Mike Woods, fourth at the 1979 World All-Arounds. Oxholm got off to a fast start on Woods, who never caught up, with Oxholm posting 14:36.60 and Woods 14:39.53.
Heiden was in the second pair with Soviet Viktor Lyoskin, the world record holder at 14:34.33, a top international competitor, and considered a formidable opponent. Heiden’s PR going into Lake Placid was 14:43.11 and Lyoskin tried to intimidate him, starting out at a suicidal pace, leading by over 2 seconds at eight laps. But Heiden skated his own race, steadily grinding Lyoskin down, catching him shortly after the 12th lap, and then crushing him in the second half of the race, eventually bettering his time by over 23 seconds. Heiden finished in 14:28.13, a remarkable world record considering the slow Lake Placid rink and it would bring him his unprecedented fifth gold medal.
This was the first time that any Olympic athlete had won five individual gold medals at a single Olympic Games, and that would not be equaled until Michael Phelps did so in swimming at Beijing in 2008. Oxholm would eventually win a bronze medal, with Woods finishing fourth, as the silver medal went to Dutchman Piet Kleine, the defending champion, who had been competing internationally since the early 1970s and went off in the sixth pair.

Yet in 1935 Switzerland, represented by the Zurich Rowing Club, had won the Cup, which was only the second time since 1873 that Great Britain had been defeated in the tournament. By repeating their victory in 1936, the Swiss delegation – Hermann Betschart, Alex and Hans Homberger, and Karl Schmid – made themselves the first non-British favorites at the Olympics. They had also been the winners at the 1935 European Championships.
In the opening round Switzerland defeated Great Britain in their heat by over three seconds, but the fastest time went to the Germans, represented by Rudolf Eckstein, Martin Karl, Willi Menne, and Toni Rom of Würzburger RV Bayern, who had won the 1934 European Championships. With the two victors advancing directly to the finals, the semi-finals essentially served as a repêchage, with Austria, Denmark (who had won the 1933 European Championships with a different crew), Great Britain, and Italy qualifying. The Swiss rowers were hampered by exhaustion, its quartet having competed earlier in the coxed fours event (they were also members of the coxed eights crew), which led to the final evolving into a contest between Germany and Great Britain. The latter put out a strong effort, but the host nation won by a comfortable margin of nearly five seconds and took the gold medal. Great Britain settled for silver while Switzerland managed to outperform the remaining nations and capture bronze.

In Atlanta he proved his supremacy beyond doubt and was never really troubled in any of his 4 fights.

They had an outstanding Olympic record, winning four of the five finals up to 2016, and finishing second in the other, to Norway after sudden-death extra-time in 2000. Seven members of their squad had already won Olympic gold, including goalkeeper Hope Solo, who was going for a record fourth gold in Rio. USA also had the reigning Word Player of the Year, Carli Lloyd, in their squad.
Being on home soil, Brazil, the 2015 Pan-Am champions, looked likely to provide stiff opposition  to the USA. Their team included the five-times Word Player of the Year Marta, and 38-year-old midfielder Formiga, an ever-present since the first Olympic tournament in 1996, thus playing in her sixth Games. The European challenge was expected to come from France, FIFA ranked three, and the talented Germans, twice World Cup winners and three times Olympic bronze medallist, and the number two ranked team by FIFA.
The tournament got off to a great start with Janine Beckie of Canada scoring the fastest goal in Olympic history, when she netted after just 20 seconds against Australia on the first day of the tournament. It beat by 10 seconds the goal scored by Oribe Peralta of Mexico in the 2012 men’s final against Brazil. Sadly for Beckie, her record stood only two weeks until bettered by six seconds by Brazil’s Neymar in the men’s semi-final against Honduras.
The United States qualified as top of their group despite being held by Colombia in their final group game. It was Colombia women’s first ever point in the Olympics. In the USA’s 1-0 win over France, Hope Solo became the first goalkeeper in the world, male or female, to win 200 caps. Germany also qualified for the knockout stage, but only as the second best team in their group behind Canada. They were held to a surprise 2-2 draw in their second group game by the Australians after coming from two goals down and scoring a late equaliser. Australia had the youngest member of the football tournament (men and women) in their squad - 16 -year-old defender Ellie Carpenter. To make matters worse for the Germans, they lost their final group game 2-1 to Canada.  Brazil qualified from their group as the only South American nation in the last eight, while Germany were joined by fellow Europeans Sweden and France, and China and Australia made up the quarter-finals.
The first last eight match saw one of the biggest upsets in women’s Olympic football history as the United States lost to Sweden in the first ever women’s penalty shoot-out. It was also the United States’ first defeat in the Olympics since a 2-0 loss to Norway in a group match in 2008. The US coach who guided them to gold that year, and again in 2012, was Pia Sundhage, and she was now Sweden’s head coach who masterminded their win over the USA in 2016. After the match, Hope Solo called the Swedes “A bunch of cowards”. These remarks earned her a six month suspension from the US team after the Olympics and the termination of her US Soccer Federation contract after 17 years.
Shortly after Sweden’s win in that first ever penalty-shoot out, along came a second when Brazil beat Australia 7-6 on penalties after finishing goalless after 120 minutes. The semi-finals were made up with world number two Germany beating China 1-0 and world number 10 Canada surprising the third ranked FIFA team, France, by the same scoreline.
All four teams in the semis were searching for their first Olympic title and the Brazilian women were hoping to achieve that goal before their male counterparts, albeit by a day, but it was not to be. Just as they did in their win over the USA, Sweden approached the game against Brazil with a defensive attitude and were happy to keep the game goalless for 120 minutes and take the game to penalties. They were all square in the shoot-out when Andressa’s spot kick was saved and Dahlkvist scored the winning goal for the Europeans. Germany made it an all-European final after beating 2012 bronze medalists Canada 2-0 with goals from Melane Behringer and Sara Däbritz.
Having lost out on the chance to become Brazil’s first Olympic soccer champions, the ladies team was hoping at least for a bronze medal but it was Canada who opened the scoring in the bronze medal match in the 25th minute through Deanne Rose who, at 17, was the youngest member of the Canadian squad. They increased their lead on 52 minutes through Christine Sinclair and they seemed to have secured the bronze medal, but when Beatriz scored for the hosts 11 minutes from time it set up a tense finale. Canada held on for back-to-back bronze medals as they became the first Canadians to win consecutive medals in a Summer Olympics team sport since they won lacrosse gold in both 1904 and 1908.
Both Sweden, ranked six, and Germany, ranked two, were in the women’s final for the first time and, for Sweden, it was at the sixth time of asking, having appeared in every edition since women’s football first appeared at Atlanta in 1996. They had never won a medal previously and Germany’s best finish was third on three occasions. The final was a repeat of the 2004 bronze medal match, which Germany won 1-0.
After a goalless first half at the Maracanã, Dzsenifer Marozsan put Germany ahead three minutes into the second half, with a curling finish. Their lead was extended on 62 minutes when Linda Sembrant put through her own goal after Marozsan’s free-kick hit the post. Five minutes later Sweden pulled a goal back when a cross from Kosse Asslani was turned into the goal by Stina Blackstenius, but one goal was not enough and Germany won 2-1. It was their first ever women’s Olympic football gold medal, and the first for the German nation since the GDR men took gold at Montreal in 1976.

But the Soviet Union had a strong team, headed by 24-year old Nikolay Zimyatov, the tall and lanky silver medalist at the distance at the 1978 World Championships. At 10 km, Zimyatov was in the lead, 13 seconds ahead of the Swede Thomas Wassberg. Lying third, to everyone’s surprise, was Bulgarian Ivan Lebanov, 1977 Junior World Champion, 19.5 seconds behind the leader. And the young Bulgarian continued to impress. At the halfway mark he had moved up to second place, 36 seconds behind the leading Zimyatov, but he was closely followed by Wassberg and Soviet Vasily Rochev. Zimyatov continued to push the pace, at 20 km he had widened his lead to 40 seconds, but behind him it was very close: Wassberg now second, Lebanov third and Rochev fourth, all three within 8 seconds. Rochev, starting first of the favorites, was fastest over the last 10 km and finished in impressive style. Zimyatov, starting one minute behind Lobanov, caught the Bulgarian 5 km from home, and they finished together. Zimyatov came in half a minute ahead of his countryman Rochev, and Lobanov was now in bronze medal position. Wassberg, starting last of all, could not match Lobanov’s speed over the last kilometers and had to be content with fourth place. The surprise winner of the 15 km in the 1978 World Championships, the Pole Józef Łuszczek, made his best ever Olympic placing by finishing fifth. Zimyatov won his first international championship, and Lobanov won the first ever Winter Olympics medal for Bulgaria, and it would be another 18 years before the next.

The Soviets had by then won five successive titles at the World and Olympic level and, in addition, their team contained two of the medallists in the individual event. All went smoothly and they duly reached their designated place in the final where their opponents would be an Italian team they had already defeated in the group stages. This is where reality took a divergent course from what was expected to happen.
Led by an inspired performance from reigning World Champion Michele Maffei, Italy upset the Soviets by a surprisingly wide 9-5 margin. The scale of the Italian achievement is best demonstrated by the fact that while they had been nearly unbeaten in the recent past, Italy had not won a medal at any of the intervening World Championships since they had won silver in Mexico.
Hungary beat Romania for the bronze medal.

They were drawn in the same group, however, which Farkas won as Zander only finished fourth in Group B, and eighth overall. In the final Farkas met Poland’s Piotr Stępień, whose only previous international medal was a silver in the 1989 Europeans. As expected it was an easy gold medal victory for Farkas, 6-1. The bronze was won by Unified Team wrestler Daulet Turlykhanov, who had won a silver medal in 1988 as a welterweight.
In The Complete Book of the Olympics David Wallechinsky described the travails that came to Farkas, and his brother, in the next few years, “Péter Farkas became a popular heart-throb singer in Hungary. In 2004 he and his brother Karoly, were arrested after police discovered more than 3,000 marijuana plants growing in their mother’s basement in Budapest. Péter and Karoly escaped from police custody in November 2008 shortly before being sentenced to five years in prison. Karoly pretended to be ill and the two left the court room during the break between the announcement of the verdict and sentencing, and did not return. Karoly was captured almost immediately, but Péter was not rearrested until a year later in Andorra. Their sentences were subsequently extended to seven years.” Zander turned out a bit better and won a silver medal in this class at Atlanta in 1996.

Uladzislau Hancharou of Belarus was also slated as a name to watch, as the defending Olympic champion from Rio 2016.
Hancharou and Ivan Litvinovich of Belarus finished first and second in the qualifiers, followed by Dylan Schmidt of New Zealand, Dominic Clarke of Australia, and Dong in fifth. The final additionally featured gymnasts from Japan, as well as two from ROC. A surprising crash onto the mat by Gao of China during his second routine of the qualifiers resulted in a disappointing score of 10.575 in addition to his 52.245, plummeting him down to 14th place and preventing him from advancing to the final.
Dong seemed well on his way to another gold medal finishing with a score of 61.235 in his final routine, until Ivan Litvinovich of Belarus, who finished first in the qualifiers, put up a score of 61.715 to surpass him and claim the gold. Dylan Schmidt of New Zealand finished with the bronze with a score of 60.675, enough to pass the defending champion Hancharou (60.565) of Belarus. This would be Belarus’ first medal of Tokyo 2020.

The 1992 title was again expected to be contested between these two superpowers of the sport. Before competition started the Germans suffered a setback when Germany II’s pilot Horst Czudaj was accused of spying on his team mates for the East German security forces in the late eighties. Although he was eventually cleared to compete, the controversy appeared to affect his concentration and he finished no higher than sixth.
The struggle for the Olympic gold was intense but it was neither a German or Swiss crew that stood on the top step of the podium at the end of the second day. Ingo Appelt and Austria I had been third in the 1990 World Championships but was not expected to challenge for the gold in Albertville.  The Austrians made up for a poor second run by producing three excellent ones and had just 0.02 of a second to spare when they crossed the line.
Canada II’s Olympic adventure ended in high farce. It was true that they crossed the line safely enough on the third run but without twenty-five percent of their crew. Jack Pyc had slipped at the start, failed to get into the bob and slid around several corners before coming to a halt. The team were disqualified. A similar fate nearly befell a Unified Team crew member as he also slipped attempting to enter his sled.  Oleksandr Bortiuk did make it into the bob albeit facing in the opposite direction to which he intended.

Viljoen opened with 64.92 in the final to take the lead, a mark she would not better and one that eventually brought her the silver medal. That held up until round four when Kolak threw 66.18 to take the lead. Špotáková challenged Viljoen in round five with 64.80, a mark that brought her the bronze medal.

West German Karl Schultz took the lead after the dressage, followed by Davidson. Schultz then finished fifth in the endurance phase and took the lead after the jumping. The endurance contest was led by American J. Michael Plumb followed by his teammate Tad Coffin. Coffin moved into second, followed by Plumb, with Prior-Palmer in fourth, and Meade fifth going into the jumping, as Davidson struggled and dropped back to 11th place.
Schultz made two faults in the jumping, costing him 20 points, and this dropped him off the top step of the podium and down to a bronze medal. Coffin rode cleanly in jumping, as did 11 other riders, which brought him the gold medal. Plumb had one fault in jumping but was able to hold onto second place and the silver medal. Plumb first competed at the Olympics in 1960 and would compete in seven Olympics through 1992, also making the 1980 US Olympic team.

The pair had podium finishes in all synchronised events they contested leading up to the Olympics in 2016, and were considered medal candidates in Rio, but to capture gold, the British pair, and the other six pairs, would have to be at their very best to beat the Chinese pair of Chen Aisen and Lin Yue, the 2015 World Champions and 2016 World Cup winners. As it turned out, the Chinese duo were so outstanding that, after the first dive, they took the lead and never lost it, winning by 39.87 points, helped by a wonderful fifth dive which saw them score 106.56 points. In total they received five maximums.
After two dives it was clear that the United States were going to be the nearest challengers, but it was a close battle between Great Britain, Germany, Mexico, Ukraine and Russia for the bronze medal. After three dives, only a couple of points separated those five countries. Germany moved into third place after round four while Britain slipped to fifth place, but they moved back to third after their penultimate dive when they emulated the dive that netted Chen and Lin their 106.56 and, whilst not to the same high standard of the Chinese duo, Daley and Goodfellow managed 92.13. With one round to go, and the last to dive, the British pair knew what they had to do to take bronze and they did it with over six points to spare.

The major threat to the Chinese was from Britain’s Jack Laugher, the 2016 Rio silver medallist and 2019 3-metre FINA World Series winner.
In the preliminary round, it was the Chinese pair who dominated and, despite Xie leading after the first dive, it was Wang who lead after dive number two, and remained in the lead to qualify ahead of Xie, who scored the only 100 of qualifying with a magnificent forward four-and-a-half somersaults in his fifth and final dive. Laugher was second after the first dive but two disastrous rounds followed as he slipped to 12th, before recovering to qualify in sixth place, two places below the other Briton James Heatly. Mexico’s Rommel Pacheco qualified in third place.
Again, the semi-final was dominated by just two men, Xie and Wang, while the British pair of Heatly and Laugher qualified in third and fourth place. Xie’s final dive was a forward 4.5 somersaults in tuck that saw him score 100.70 points as he led his compatriot by nearly three points with Laugher nearly 50 points behind in fourth and Heatly, the grandson of the 1948 and 1952 Olympic diver Peter Heatly, a further 60 points behind Laugher.
The final belonged to just one man, Xie Siyi, who led from start to finish while Wang occupied second place throughout, except for after dive two, when Laugher briefly moved into the silver medal position. From the half-way mark, the three medal positions were almost certainly going to go to the two Chinese divers and Laugher.
Laugher was guaranteed a medal after temporarily taking the lead with his sixth and final dive. Wang went next and his forward 4.5 somersaults in tuck was good enough to put him ahead of Laugher with 102.60 and then the two-time world champion Xie Siyi matched Wang’s dive to score the same points and win the gold by nearly 24 points. For Xie Siyi it made up of missing the Rio Games because of a broken ankle. There were emotional scenes at the end of the competition as Mexico’s Rommel Pacheco bowed out of Olympic competition after appearing at four Games since 2004. He finished sixth in his finale.

Her winning time in 2002 was also the world record, and she had additionally won the 2003 World Championships. Clara Hughes was a former cyclist, having medaled in the 1996 Olympics. Returning to her first sport, speed skating, she won a third Olympic bronze in that sport in 2002. An expert in the longest distance on the women’s programme, Hughes had won the World Championships in 2004.
Two other medal contenders were not skating in Torino. 2002 runner-up Gretha Smit had made the Dutch team, but could not race as Dutch performances in the Olympic 3000 m meant that only two Dutch skaters could race. Polish skater Katarzyna Wójcicka later revealed she had been offered more than €40,000 to forfeit her place in the race in favor of Smit, although this was later denied by both Smit and her coach Ingrid Paul. The reigning World Champion, Anni Friesinger of Germany, was also missing from the starting list, citing exhaustion after four Olympic races.
The race followed the draw closely, with the best times coming from the last two pairs. The Czech flagbearer, junior skater Martina Sáblíková had hoped to win her country’s first ever Olympic speed skating medal in her favorite event. She was pegged against Cindy Klassen, who had already won four medals during the Games, including a gold medal in the 1500 m. As expected, Klassen started very fast, leaving Sáblíková far behind. The fast pace left Klassen exploding in the final laps, seeing her 5-second lead decrease rapidly in the last two laps. In the end, she managed to stay less than a second ahead of Sáblíková.
The final pair was one of the more exciting races of the Olympics. Pechstein sprinted away from known slow-starter Hughes. As both trailed Klassen’s fast split times, Hughes gradually picked up. At 4 km, Pechstein appeared to make a decisive move, but Hughes countered and first led the race at 4,600 m, albeit only by 0.15 seconds. With both skaters still two seconds behind Klassen’s time, Hughes outsprinted Pechstein for the gold, with the German finishing fast enough to also beat Klassen for the silver.

At the Europeans, Romania, represented in Rio by Mădălina Bereș and Laura Oprea, had been the Britons’ most consistent competitors, although New Zealand was the only nation aside from Britain to have reached the podium at each of the last three editions of the World Championships. This country sent Genevieve Behrent and Rebecca Scown to the 2016 Games, the latter of whom was a 2012 Olympic bronze medalist and 2010 and 2011 World Champion. Australia, the 2012 Olympic runner-up, did not participate in this event.
Great Britain and New Zealand won their preliminary heats, but Romania finished a surprising last in a heat won by Americans Grace Luczak and Felice Mueller, the latter of whom was 2015 World bronze medalist. Luczak, meanwhile, was had twice been World Champion in the eights and once in the fours. Romania rebounded by winning the repêchage, but was eliminated in the semifinals behind Great Britain, the United States, and South Africans Lee-Ann Persse and Kate Christowitz. In the other semifinal, the unheralded Danish duo of Hedvig Rasmussen and Anne Andersen finished ahead of the New Zealanders to earn an unexpected berth in the final. There they performed admirably and even led for a time in an exciting race, but were no match ultimately for the Britons and the New Zealanders, who finished first and second respectively, leaving Denmark to settle for bronze.

The silver medal went to Raimondo D’Inzeo, whose second round was the only other clean ride in the competition. His brother, Piero D’Inzeo, was the bronze medalist, finishing with 11.00 faults.
Winkler competed at six Olympics (1956-76) winning five gold medals, one silver, and one bronze, but this was his only individual medal. Raimondo D’Inzeo competed at eight Olympics (1948-76), winning six medals with one gold – in this event in 1960. His brother, Piero, also competed at the same eight Olympics, also winning six medals, but no golds. He would win the silver medal in this event in 1960.
Winkler’s mount Halla, a bay mare, would follow him to the 1960 Olympics and win a team gold there, in addition to his two jumping golds in Stockholm, as Halla became the first horse to win three Olympic gold medals. Halla was by a trotting stallion and was foaled on 16 May 1945. She competed through the Brussels Grand Prix on 25 October 1960 and then was retired to stud, later dying in 1979, at 34-years-old.

The halfway mark was finished in 1-15:11, when Romania’s Constantina Dita decided to push the pace. The pace seemed fast and the other favorites, notably Kenyan Catherine Ndereba, did not go with her. By 35K she had opened a 70-second lead. Britain’s Paula Radcliffe, the world-record holder, had gamely hung on early, but injuries had her well below her best and she barely finished, placing 23rd. In the last few kilometers, the chase group closed somewhat on Dita, but she was never in any trouble, winning by 22 seconds over Ndereba, to become the oldest Olympic marathon champion ever, man or woman. Chinese runners Zhou Chunxiu and Zhu Xiaolin closed quickly to finish 3-4.

Irie had shown glimpses of her ability in her few pre-Olympic international appearances but she was given little chance of winning gold, despite the home “crowd” support. However, Irie made the most of a series of upsets in the second round of fights which saw all four seeded fighters exit the competition in their first contests. The top seed, world champion Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei fell to Nesthy Petecio of the Philippines.
The Japanese fighter won a closely contested semi-final by outlasting British opponent Karriss Artingstall to book a place in the gold medal bout against Petecio, who outpointed Italy’s Irma Testa earlier in the day.
The final was a repeat of a bout from the 2019 World Championships, only this time Irie was two years more experienced. Irie’s long range work captured the first round though Petecio upped her game to take the second. With all depending on the final three minutes the fight descended into a messy round of clinching and holding until the final minute where Irie imposed her jab on her tiring opponent. Four judges scored the bout 29-28 for Irie, while the other had it a 30-27 shutout.

The 100 strokes had all been decided in Seoul by the time this event started and the best East German times added up to 4:03.90, while the best American times came to only 4:07.77. The biggest problem for East Germany was where to put Kristin Otto, who had won the 100 free, 100 back, and 100 fly. They rested her in the prelims and then had her lead off on backstroke in the final. Her 1:01.03 split had her over 1½ seconds ahead of the USA’s Beth Barr and the race for gold was over. East Germany increased their margin on each leg, winning in 4:03.74, the second fastest time ever. The USA was well back for silver, finishing in 4:07.90, but that was also almost three seconds ahead of the Canadians, who finished third.

In the final Lőrincz  faced Kyrgyzstan’s Akzhol Makhmudov, defeating him 2-1 in a dull match. One day later, Tamás Lőrincz’s brother Viktor would add a silver medal to the family trophy chest by placing second at 87 kg Greco-Roman. Makhmudov was a 2018 Asian Champion but had only made it to the Olympics by winning an Olympic qualifying tournament earlier in 2021.

She already had four Olympic medals in the event, gold from 1996 and 2000, silver from 2004, and bronze from 2008, as well as six World Championship titles that spanned from 1997 through 2009 and a bronze medal from the quadruple sculls event at the 1992 Summer Olympics. She had lost the World Championship title in the last two years, first to Frida Svensson of Sweden in 2010, and then to Miroslava Knapková of the Czech Republic in 2011, both of whom were contenders for the gold medal in London. Kim Crow of Australia was a factor as well, as she elected to compete in both the single and double scull events at the 2012 Olympics, capturing silver in the latter race.
The three fastest times in the heats went to Zhang Xiuyun of China, an Olympic silver medalist in the double sculls from 1996, Knapková, and Fie Udby Erichsen of Denmark, a relative unknown. Crow picked up the fastest time in the quarterfinals, with Knapková just over a second on her heels and Erichsen again posting a surprise third-fastest time. By the semi-finals, however, it was Knapková who had earned the best time, followed by Erichsen and Crow, an order that remained through the final, where Knapková took the lead immediately and was untouchable for nearly the entire race; at the 1500m mark, she was over seven seconds ahead of the rest of the pack. Her Olympic rowing gold medal was the first for the Czech Republic since its 1993 independence. The race for silver came down to the wire, but Erichsen edged out Crow by approximately three-tenths of a second, giving Crow bronze, her second medal of the regatta.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"The men’s weightlifting competition in Tokyo started as always with the lightest weight class. With the 56 kg class being discontinued after the Rio Games, this was now the 61 kg class and was the “heaviest” lightest weight ever contested. Between 1920-36 it was 60 kg, and between 1948-2016 the lightest weight was at weights between 52 and 56 kg.
There were two clear favourites in China’s Li Fabin and Indonesia’s Eko Irawan. Li was the reigning 2019 world champion, and won silver behind Irawan in 2018. Li was also the winner of the last two Asian Championships in 2019 and 2020 (held in April 2021), and was the reigning world record holder in snatch (145 kg) and total (318 kg). Irawan, competing in his fourth Olympics, was world champion in 2018 and the gold medallist (in the 62 kg category) at the 2018 Asian Games, when China was suspended by the International Weightlifting Federation. Irawan was also the world record holder in clean & jerk with 174 kg. Other participants included Thạch Kim Tuấn, gold medallist at the 2010 Youth Olympics and world champion in 2017 (both 56 kg class), Seraj Al-Saleem, season best 286 kg, and silver medallist at the last Asian Championships, Igor Son, qualification best 286 kg, and silver medallist at the last World Championships, and Shota Mishvelidze, qualification best 293 kg, silver medallist at the 2021 European Championships. The gold medallist at the last European Championships, Stilyan Grozdev, was not present in Tokyo as the Bulgarian federation was restricted to two male and two female lifters over all classes following more than ten doping violations. Also, not present in Tokyo was Francisco Mosquera (Colombia), season best 280 kg, world champion 2017 (62 kg) and bronze medallist at the last World Championships, who had previously missed the 2016 Olympics due to an injury. Ferdi Hardal (Turkey), with a season best 287 kg, and bronze medallist from the 2021 European Championships, also originally qualified for Tokyo. Mosquera was ranked fourth and Hardal ranked eighth, but their federations did not select them because of the restriction following many doping offences.
When Li and Irawan started with their snatch attempts all other competitors had already ended all their attempts with Yoichi Itokazu being in the lead with 133 kg. Irawan lifted 137 kg in his first attempt while Li failed at the same weight, but Irawan was not able to lift 141 kg in his next two attempts, while Li cleared 137 kg with his second and 141 kg with his third lift. This gave Li a margin of 4 kg before the clean & jerk; here again all other lifters had already finished their attempts with Son lifting 163 kg in his last attempt after Itokazu had already missed 162 kg in his final lift. That put Son in the bronze medal position, but he had to wait until Shota Mishvelidze and Seraj Al-Saleem had finished their attempts as both tried to lift weights good enough for bronze, but both failed. While Itokazu finished fourth, Irawan managed 165 kg in his first attempt, but as Li countered with 166 kg and also lifted 172 kg, Irawan had to go for a new world record, but missed the remaining two attempts over 177 kg. This gave Li gold and Irawan his second silver medal to go with the one he collected in 2016. Together with his two bronze medals from 2008 and 2012, Irawan’s medal tally increased to four, which made him the first and only Indonesian to win four medals at the Olympics. Remarkable was Li’s 166 kg clean & jerk lift, when he shifted his weight onto one leg and sticking out his right leg bringing it completely up off the ground, a move he had already shown in other competitions and called by his fans the “flamingo lift”. He said he is doing this to correct his balance, not to impress the jury or the crowd.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 142 kg for snatch, 171 kg for clean & jerk, and 310 kg for total. The standard was not reached in snatch, but in clean & jerk and total, Li established a record with 172 kg and 313 kg, respectively. China won its second gold medal at the Tokyo Games and Indonesia won its second medal with silver, after Windy Aisah won bronze the day before.

(29.1 miles).,na,"Three days before this event, Germany’s Jan Ullrich had won the road race. One of the world’s top road racers, the winner of the Tour de France in 1997, Ullrich was a time trial specialist and was the favorite. His biggest competition was expected to come from Lance Armstrong. Armstrong had competed in both the 1992 and 1996 Olympics, but had not yet an Olympic medal. Shortly after the 1996 Olympics, he was discovered to have testicular cancer, which had metastasized to his brain and liver. Enduring long courses of chemotherapy, and several surgeries, his return to the professional peloton was in doubt. But return he did, winning the Tour de France in both 1999 and 2000, with Ullrich second in 2000, and Armstrong would eventually win the race seven consecutive times – 1999-2005. Also formidable in the time trial, the race was expected to come down to these two, and they were the last two riders off. The 25th rider to start, of 38, was Russian Vyacheslav Yekimov. Yekimov, a 1988 gold medalist in the team pursuit and former world champion in the individual pursuit, was now a top professional road racer, and had served as a capable lieutenant on Armstrong’s US Postal Service team. He had a very long career and in the late 80s, had been the top individual pursuiter in the world for the Soviet Union. When Yekimov started the time trial, the leader was Kazakh Andrey Teteryuk but Yekimov finished in 57:40, besting Teteryuk by over a minute. And the time held up as numerous top pros had failed to better it by the time Armstrong and Ullrich started. At the first checkpoint, they trailed Yekimov’s time, and they were never able to get ahead of him, as Yekimov won a very surprising gold medal, with Ullrich second and Armstrong seemingly winning his only Olympic medal, a bronze.
Even though Armstrong was the dominant cyclist of the decade whispers of drug use continued to haunt him. He may have retired with the reputation intact but the United States Anti-Doping agency were hard on his trail. In August 2012 they announced that their long investigation had concluded that he had used illegal performance-enhancing drugs from 1998 onwards and they voided his results for the period of his greatest successes including all his Tour De France victories. His Olympic medal was also forfeited.

His staggered victories made him the first Olympic gymnast ever to win an individual event twice, but not consecutively. Li had been hampered by foot and ankle injuries since 2000, finally undergoing surgery in 2006. The silver went to Korean Yon Won-Cheol, the 2006 silver medalist at the Worlds.

There were three other major contenders – the super-G gold medalist Kjetil André Aamodt (NOR), the 1991-92 World Cup leader Paul Accola (SUI), and the peripatetic Marc Girardelli (LUX). Girardelli had been a four-time overall World Cup champion, and coming into Albertville was considered the greatest skier without an Olympic medal, although he had ended that in the super-G with a silver. Girardelli was born in Austria and lived mostly in Switzerland. He had acquired Luxembourgeois citizenship after he and his father had disputes with the Austrian ski team. He had been unable to compete at the 1984 Winter Olympics because he did not obtain his citizenship in time, and although he competed at Calgary in 1988, he struggled there.
There were 131 skiers in the event, the largest entry ever in Winter Olympic skiing, and the first run seemingly took forever to complete. To make it more time-consuming, the course was not that difficult and a full 109 skiiers finished and competed in the second run. The first run went according to form, with Tomba leading, following by Girardelli, Aamodt, and Accola. Tomba again posted the fastest time in the second run, to defend his gold medal, with the order unchanged – Girardelli getting his second silver in Albertville, Aamodt winning bronze, and Accola in fourth place. Tomba’s performance made him the first Alpine skier to defend a title at the Winter Olympics.
Near the end of the race, Raymond Keyrouz was the 129th starter. But he was so slow that he was passed by the 130th starter El-Hassan Mahta. Both were eventually disqualified for missing gates.

It was renamed right after Sochi, but the format was still the same with one downhill run and one slalom run. Only one World Cup event was held in the ongoing season in Lenzerheide and it was won by Wendy Holdener, followed by Marta Bassino and Ana Bucik. Holdener was also the 2017 World Champion and the Alpine Combined Crystal Globe winner from 2015/16. The Alpine Combined World Cup winner in 2016/17, Ilka Štuhec, did not compete in PyeongChang due to an ACL injury to her left knee that she sustained in October 2017. Also not present in South Korea were Tina Maze, 2015 World Champion, and all three medalists from Sochi, as all four had retired. In addition to Holdener, Mikaela Shiffrin, Michelle Gisin, runner-up at the 2017 Worlds, and Petra Vlhová were considered medal contenders.
The first phase saw Lindsey Vonn in the lead after the downhill, but she was not considered a medal favorite as she no longer competed or trained for slalom. Following her was Ragnhild Mowinckel in second, but 0.74 seconds behind. From the medal contenders Gisin preformed best, finishing in third place and she was a full 1.21 seconds in front of sixth-placed Shiffrin. Holdener was in 10th, 1.97 seconds behind Gisin, and Vlhová was farther back in 13th. From only 28 starters 22 qualified for the second run and, as in the technical events, they started in reverse order which meant that Vlhová, starting 10th, was the first of the favorites to compete. She had a good run, which would be the second fastest run time, but at the end finished outside the medals in fifth. The fastest run time was set by Holdener and she took the lead until Shiffrin bettered her overall time. With three skiers to go Gisin took advantage of her comfortable lead and easily topped the results. Mowinckel was not able to threaten the top three and placed fourth, while Vonn did not finish the slalom run.
Michelle Gisin became the first ever female Olympic champion in Alpine Combined for Switzerland and followed her sister Dominique, who won gold in downhill four years earlier, to win a second gold medal for the Gisin family. Rossignol, with Gisin, won their second gold at this Games, Shiffrin used Atomic, and Holdener skied Head.

But during the 1968 season a new talent had arisen, Bob Beamon, who was undefeated in pre-Olympic competition. The thin air of Ciudad de México was expected to produce big jumps, and it did, but nobody was prepared for what was to come. In the qualifying Boston set an Olympic record with 8.27 (27-1¾).
The fourth jumper in the final was Beamon, and he had no marks to aim at as the first three jumpers had fouled. Beamon tore down the runway, hit the takeoff board perfectly, and took off, reaching a huge height. He came down hard and bounded out of the pit. Watching, Boston commented to Davis, “That’s over 28 feet,” but Davies felt that was not possible. Boston was actually conservative. The jump was over 29 feet – 29-2½ or 8.90, to be exact. The world record, held by Boston and Ter-O was 8.35, or 27-4¾; thus, Beamon had surpassed it by almost two feet. It was the largest single improvement in a track & field world record ever, and stunning athletic feats since that date are often labeled “Beamonesque.” The mark was so spectacular that a book was written about this single athletic moment, called The Perfect Jump, written by Dick Schaap in collaboration with Beamon.
The competition was over. Davies told Boston, “We can’t go on. We’d look silly.” Ter-Ovanesyan commented to Davies, “Compared to this jump, we are children.” After the jump, Beamon was not really sure what he had accomplished, not understanding the metric measurement. But when he was told it was 29-2½, he collapsed to his knees and became dizzy, having to be helped up by Boston and teammate Charlie Mays.
Eventually the long jump went on. Boston completed his medal set by winning a bronze. The great trivia question is the identity of the silver medalist – Klaus Beer of East Germany. Beamon took one more jump, 8.04 (26-4½), then passed his final four rounds, as they were not necessary. Lynn Davies tied for eighth after three jumps, and was mistakenly not advanced to the final three rounds of jumps. When officials realized what had happened, they offered him three more jumps. He refused, shattered by what he had seen.
There have been naysayers since. The wind reading was 2.0 metres per second, the exact limit of legal, and some observers think the jump may have been wind-aided, but no protests to its legality as a record were ever made. The mark stood up for 23 years, finally bettered in 1991 by Mike Powell, who jumped 8.95 (29-4½) to win the 1991 World Championships. As of 2022, Beamon’s mark is still the second longest legal jump ever, and still the Olympic record, probably for the foreseeable future as well. Beamon never jumped anywhere near as well again. He never had to.

Each team could nominate a maximum of twelve athletes, of which a maximum of six entered the mat in each round. As soon as one team won four of the six bouts it was declared the winner and proceeded to the next round. In case of a 3-3 draw, an additional decisive bout was scheduled. At World Championships, the format was introduced in 2018, and in all four finals France faced Japan with Japan winning the title at every occasion. Based on the results of the individual events, this seemed to be the logical outcome also at the Olympics. So far, Japan won nine gold and one bronze and France one gold, three silver and three bronze, of which only two bronze came from the men’s events.
Both teams were spared from the elimination round, just like the teams of the Russian Olympic Committee and Brazil, two potential contenders for bronze. In the quarter-final, Japan, calling up six gold medallists, defeated Germany 4-2, but only after being behind 0-2. France also had a hard time beating Israel 4-3, when the extra fight had to be decided by Golden Score. While the Russian victory over Mongolia did not come unexpectedly, the Netherlands scored a 4-2 upset over Brazil, bronze medallist at the last two World Championships. Brazil was finally eliminated in the repêchage by Israel. Germany made the bronze medal contest by defeating Mongolia.
In the semi-finals, Japan and France scored one-sided 4-0 wins against the ROC and the Netherlands, respectively, without having to go into extra-time in any of the matches. The bronze medals were eventually taken by the dark horse Israel and Germany. In the final, four gold medallists represented Japan: Shohei Ono, Chizuru Arai, Akira Sone, and Aaron Wolf, and they were complemented by bronze medallist Tsukasa Yoshida and ninth placed Shoichiro Mukai. The French team consisted of Clarisse Agbegnenou (silver), Sarah-Léonie Cysique (silver), Romane Dicko and Teddy Riner (both bronze), and non-medallists Axel Clerget, and Guillaume Chaine. Agbegnenou moved up one category and collected two Waza-aris (half points) to defeat the Japanese gold medallist Arai. Clerget threw Mukai by Sumi-otoshi (corner drop) in extra-time for a 2-0 lead. Sone, who already won gold on the day before, outscored Dicko by two Waza-ari to revive Japan’s hopes. French heavyweight legend Teddy Riner then scored a Waza-ari for the Golden Score in the clash of gold medallists defeating half-heavyweight Wolf to give France a comfortable lead. Sarah-Léonie Cysique held on to an early lead by Waza-ari against Yoshida to earn France the fourth point and, hence, the gold medal. Despite leaving Japan in disappointment, the new event was considered a successful addition to the judo program.

He had long dreamed of competing in the Winter Olympics, trying out as a speed skater and a bobsledder before finding success in the skeleton. His compatriot Pain, who took silver, was also well in his thirties, making for one of the “oldest” podiums in Winter Olympic history.

Only 10 days before the start of the 1996 Olympics, one of their star pitchers from the 1992 team, Roland Arroyo, defected.  Another top pitcher, José Contreras, would later defect to the United States, and became one of the first Cubans in many years to play in the Major Leagues, beginning his career in 2003 with the New York Yankees.  But Cuba still had Omar Linares and Orestes Kindelán, and their power line-up made up for their pitching weakness.  They again won every game, although Japan took them to extra innings in pool play.  In the final, Cuba repeated their victory over Japan, 13-9.  During the tournament, Linares and Kindelán combined for 17 home runs.

Armin Zöggeler, 36-year-old Olympic champion at both Salt Lake City and Torino and perenniel contender Albert Demchenko of Russia. Behind them came a plethora of German talent including reigning world champion Felix Loch and former champion David Möller.
Following the tragic death of Nodar Kumaritashvili in practice, the men’s course was shortened to start where the women normally started. Whilst the 178 metres may not sound a great distance, it changed the nature of the competition as it favoured the competitors with a powerful start over those who relied more on the technical skills of driving round a course to gain time. Felix Loch (GER), the world champion from 2008 and 2009, led from the start, and with the leading time from each of the four runs ended with a combined time of 3:13.085. He was followed closely by David Möller (GER), who had the second fastest time in each run, to finish 0.679 seconds behind Loch. Reigning champion from 2002 and 2006, Armin Zöggeler (ITA), who favoured the longer, more technical courses, had the third fastest run on his first two runs. Although his third and fourth runs saw him being the 6th and 4th fastest of the competitors respectively, his combined time of 3:14.375 was enough to give him the bronze medal. This was Zöggeler’s fifth successive Olympic medal, which tied the record of Georg Hackl, and brought his career to an end with a final total of five Olympic (2 gold), 14 World Championship (5 gold), 11 European Championships (3 gold) medals added to nine victories in the season long Word Cup series.
Loch, the son of the president of Germany’s national Luge Federation, had a strange relationship with the Whistler track. His first visit in 2008 had left him in hospital with an injured shoulder but on returning in 2009 a speed trap recorded him at 153.98 km/h (95.68 mph), the fastest speed ever recorded in the sport. At 20-years-old he added the distinction of being the sport’s youngest ever Olympic champion to that of being the youngest ever World Champion.
In last place (38th), was the 47-year-old Argentine Rubén González. This was González’s 4th Winter Games with each appearance coming in a different decade.
Most importantly, in view of the disastrous start to the Olympic programme, was that all those who started came safely home.

France was the favorite, having won gold at the past three mixed relay world championships, but Great Britain, the USA, and Germany were also rated highly. Of the original 18 entered teams only 16 actually competed with South Africa withdrawing as Henri Schoeman had broken an ankle while running the individual race. Austria resigned shortly before the start due to an Achilles’ tendon injury to Lisa Perterer. The Tokyo individual champions Kristian Blummenfelt and Flora Duffy could not compete, as their nations did not qualify enough triathletes. The weather was fine in the early morning, but again very warm with air and water temperatures of 28 degrees each.
As expected, all of the top nations had their best female swimmers in the first starting position. Britain’s Jess Learmonth came out of the water first, but the field was close together. A top quartet formed on the bike, opening a gap of just under 30 seconds on the pursuers. Learmonth finished the run in first place, while the German Laura Lindemann handed over to Jonas Schomburg in second place who passed Britain’s Jonathan Brownlee in the transition area and was the first to dive into water.
The German swam in the lead, with Brownlee, American Kevin McDowell and Dutchman Marco van der Stel in tow. The four then went on the bike course together, while the first chasing group with France, Belgium, and Italy was still half a minute behind. Brownlee then picked up the pace in the run and quickly dropped his three associates and handed over the baton to Georgia Taylor-Brown as sole leader. Behind the top group the Frenchman Dorian Coninx was almost able to close up with a strong run and Belgium, with Marten Van Riel, was only a few seconds behind.
Taylor-Brown extended the lead in swimming ahead of the American Taylor Knibb. A group formed behind them in the battle for third place after the Frenchwoman Cassandre Beaugrand was able to completely close the small gap in swimming and advanced to second place. Taylor-Brown dominated cycling as the leader and finished the section with a gap of 11 seconds. At the last change, Taylor-Brown handed over to Alex Yee, who was 21 seconds ahead of the USA, and with France and Vincent Luis 33 seconds behind in third.
The preliminary decision about the medallists had now been made, and only the order of the medals remained uncertain. Luis tried everything to bring the victory to France. He closed the gap to the American Morgan Pearson and even distanced him near the end of the swim. He chased Britain but Yee was too strong. Leading on the run, Alex Yee brought the gold medal home for Great Britain, while behind him Luis had to pay for his attacks, as Pearson caught up with him again on the first running lap and secured the silver medal for the United States.

In fact, Kulikov had set four of the last five world records, but all were set in 1975, and all at the Kazakh speed factory of Medeo. Heiden had won the 1977-80 World Sprint championships, but was considered vulnerable because of the short nature of the event, and his best time of 37.80, set at Inzell in 1979, was far from Kulikov’s 37.00 world record. In 1979 Heiden won all four races at the World Sprints, but in 1977-78, he had lost three of the four 500s at the World Sprints. And at the recent 1980 World Sprints, he had lost one 500 to US teammate Tom Plant, but Plant skated only the 1,500 in Lake Placid. Further, Heiden started on the outer, meaning he had to finish on the more difficult inner lane, but it mattered little. Kulikov started slightly faster – 10.08 to 10.13, but Heiden crushed him, 38.03 to 38.37. The time was far off Kulikov’s world record but the ice was not considered fast. Kulikov had a slight stumble on the final curve and later claimed it cost him the gold. In the second pair, Norway’s Frode Rønning posted 38.66, showing how quick Heiden’s time had been. In the fifth pair, Dutch sprinter Lieuwe de Boer, who had recently won both 500s at the Dutch Sprint Championships, came across in 38.48, which would win him the bronze medal. This was somewhat of an upset, as he had never medaled internationally. Nobody could better the times Heiden and Kulikov had set in the first pair and Heiden had his first gold medal.

The quadruple sculls in particular had not been held for either men or women, and made its first appearance in 1976 (although it was coxless for the men; the women’s event did not become coxless until 1988). As with many rowing events, the East Germans were the favorites: they had won the event at the final European Championships (the tournament had been discontinued after 1973) and at the last two World Championships. Two members of the nation’s delegation to the Montreal Games, Jutta Lau and Liane Weigelt, had been among those World Champions. There were three other nations who had meddled at the Worlds: Romania, runners-up in 1974, Bulgaria, runners-up in 1975, and the Soviet Union, bronze medalists in both editions.
In the opening round, East Germany and the Soviet Union won their heats and had the two fastest times, while Bulgaria and Romania were at their heels. In the finals, the East Germans were mostly unopposed and won the gold medal with ease.

Nevertheless England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland had refused to play the Indian side during their tour of the home nations prior to the Olympics. They did beat a “Hockey Association XI” with 9 English internationals 4-0, and an Anglo-Scottish XI 7-3, which mostly likely prompted the British withdrawal.
The Indians breezed through the preliminary round, beating all opponents with at least a five goal difference while not conceding a single goal. The other finalist was the home nation. The Dutch had been playing hockey for some time, but under their own rules. These involved a soft ball, double-sided sticks, mixed teams and no shooting circle. Dutch team captain Rein de Waal spearheaded a switch to the international rules, and also managed to arrange training sessions with the Indian team. Thanks to a surprising 2-1 victory over heavily-favored Germany, the home team made it into the final. They were no match for the Indians however, who scored three goals and then made little effort to increase the score.

The final came down to Fonst and Louis Perrée, who tied with two touches received, or effectively, having lost two bouts. They met in a barrage for the title. Perrée appeared to have won, by touching Fonst’s shoulder in the one-touch bout, but the jury ruled that the point had missed and contact had been made with the side of blade rather than its point and so the match went on. Fonst then appeared to have touched Perrée but the jury again disagreed. Perrée finally made an attack but Fonst avoided it and countered to touch Perrée to win the barrage and the event.

In an exciting and close final, the Canadians managed to edge out the Dutch favorites and capture the gold medal by a margin of less than half a second, despite a discouraging false start. The Canadians led for the first three quarters of the race, but had expended their energy and only just managed to hold on in a photo finish. Germany’s duo of Michael Schwan and Wolfgang Hottenrott, the most recent European runners-up, took a comfortable bronze ahead of the Britons.

Svindal, Olympic Super G champion four years ago, who also won the last two Super G World Cups in 2011/12 and 2012/13, was also in the World Cup lead, followed by Défago, Küng, and the silver medalist from Vancouver in this discipline, Bode Miller. The last two World championships were won by Christof Innerhofer in 2011 and Ted Ligety in 2013.
Of the early starters Peter Fill (ITA) set the target with a time of 1:18.85. Of the more favored skiers, Miller set the pace with a time of 1:18.67. Next to go was Max Franz (AUT), who finished just 0.07 seconds behind Miller. His compatriot Otmar Striedinger, going next, came even closer to Miller’s time, finishing just 0.02 seconds behind. Defending champion Aksel Lund Svindal (NOR) was next to go, but he too fell just short of Miller, by 0.11 seconds. Next down the course was downhill champion Matthias Mayer (AUT), who crashed out. Unfortunately for Miller his luck could not hold as, starting 21st, Kjetil Jansrud (NOR) set the new target with a time of 1:18.40. The next skier down, Jan Hudec (CAN) finished in exactly the same time as Miller, at that stage sharing the silver medal. But a relatively late starter Andrew Weibrecht (USA) came through to set a time of 1:18.44, so relegating Hudec and Miller to bronze medals.
Jansrud, who won his second medal in Sochi after bronze in downhill, was a surprise winner, but he continued the Norwegian tradition in this event, following his compatriots Kjetil André Aamodt who won in 2002 and 2006, and Svindal, who won in 2010. But even more surprising was Weibrecht who after winning a surprising bronze in Vancouver in this event, bettered his performance with silver in Sochi, again going from zero-to-hero as his best World Cup result was still only a 10th place at this time. Hudec won the first Alpine skiing medal for Canada after 20 years, Miller, who had lost his younger brother in the last year, showed his emotions in the finishing area after winning his sixth Olympic medal, which also made him the oldest ever Alpine skiing Olympic medalist.
Skiing manufacturer Head earned a full set of medals with Jansrud, Weibrecht, and Miller, while Hudec used Rossignol. Jansrud won the race with an average speed of 96.57 km/hr by 0.30 seconds or 8.02 metres in front of Weibrecht and 0.53 seconds or 14.12 metres in front of Hudec and Miller.
